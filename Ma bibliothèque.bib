  abstract = {The mean-square radius of gyration (S 2) was determined by small-angle X-ray scattering and light scattering for atactic oligo- and polystyrenes (a-PS) in toluene at 15.0 \textdegree C in the range of weight-average molecular weight Mw from 5.78 X 102 to 3.84 x 106. The solvent and temperature have been chosen so that the unperturbed dimension (S2) 0 of the a-PS chain in that good solvent may coincide with that in cyclohexane at 34.5 \textdegree C ( ) taken as a reference standard. The radius expansion factor as determined from (S 2{$>$} and (S decreases extremely rapidly for small Mw with decreasing Mw and tends to unity at finite Mw, in contrast to the two-parameter theory prediction. The implication is that there are significant effects of chain stiffness on a\$. The results may be quantitatively explained by the Yamakawa-Stockmayer-Shimada theory based on the wormlike and helical wormlike (HW) chain models, with an appropriate value of the excluded-volume strength B along with those of the HW model parameters established from dilute solution properties of a-PS in the unperturbed state. The theory predicts that the effect of chain stiffness on as remains rather large even at very large Mw \textasciitilde{} 106 for a-PS. It is also shown that the recent renormalization group theory of as by Chen and Noolandi does not work well, yielding a large discrepancy from the present experimental results.},

These efforts open up avenues to develop smart medical devices that respond to specific physiological conditions. In this work, an overview of nanoporous materials functionalized with responsive polymers is given. Various examples of pH, temperature and solvent responsive polymers are discussed.

We take into account the deformation of the grafted chains in the flow (non-linear effects) and show that it alters significantly their efficiency as anti-slippers. We calculate the relation between the applied shear stress and the slippage velocity. At low velocities the friction of the underformed grafted chains is strong. Above a certain threshold part of the chain relaxes through monomeric friction, and the stress becomes almost velocity independent. For even higher velocities the contribution of the grafted chains become small and a significant slippage is recovered. More generally, non-linear effects due to deformation of chains in flow are shown to be of importance at most experimental and practical velocities.},

  abstract = {Neutron Reflection (NR) and Dynamic Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (DSIMS) experiments were conducted on symmetrically deuterated polystyrene triblock bilayers (HDH/DHD) which directly probed the interdiffusion dynamics of the chains during welding. The HDH chains had their centers deuterated 50\%, the DHD chains had their ends deuterated (25\% at each end) such that each chain contained approximately 50\% D. During welding, anisotropic motion of the chains produces a time-dependent oscillation (ripple) in the H and D concentration at the interface, which bears the characteristic signature of the polymer dynamics. These oscillations were compared with those predicted by Rouse, polymer mode coupling (PMC), and reptation dynamics. The following conclusions can be made from this study. (a) During the interdiffusion of high molecular weight HDH/DHD pairs, higher mobility of the chain ends caused a concentration oscillation which increased to a maximum amplitude, and eventually vanished at times, t {$>$} {$\tau$}D. The amplitude, or excess enrichment found, was appreciably more than that predicted by Rouse and PMC simulations, and was only slightly less than that predicted from reptation simulations. (b) The oscillations were completely missing in the 30 and 50K HDH/DHD polymers, which are only weakly entangled. The lack of oscillations for the 30 and 50K pairs may be due to a combination of surface roughness and fluctuations of order 30 \AA. (c) It was found that the position of the maximum in this ripple stayed at the interface during its growth. This is also consistent with reptation and has not been explained by other theories. (d) All dynamics models for linear polymers produce ripples, many of which are qualitatively similar to that predicted for reptation. However, each ripple bears the fingerprint of the dynamics in terms of its time-dependent shape, position, and magnitude, and the models are clearly distinguishable. Our results, in summary, support reptation as a candidate mechanism of interdiffusion at polymer(SINGLEBOND) polymer interfaces and its uniqueness is being further pursued. \textcopyright{} 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

When the surface roughness is of the nanoscopic length scale, the capillary forces dominate and the liquid droplet spreads by wetting the nanoscale textures that act as capillaries. Here, using a combination of advanced nanofabrication and liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy, we image the wetting of a surface patterned with a dense array of nanopillars of varying heights. Our real-time, high-speed observations reveal that water wets the surface in two stages: 1) an ultrathin precursor water film forms on the surface, and then 2) the capillary action by nanopillars pulls the water, increasing the overall thickness of water film. These direct nanoscale observations capture the previously elusive precursor film, which is a critical intermediate step in wetting of rough surfaces.},

  abstract = {Gum Arabic is a natural acacia tree exudate containing hyperbranched polysaccharides and proteins. Here, we perform a dual chromatographic separation together with small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering structural characterizations. We show that the different species present in Gum Arabic can not be easily classified in distinct families. They are rather build from various combinations of two building blocks that are evidenced by a mismatch between small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering. One block corresponds to hyperbranched polysaccharides, which we describe as three-dimensional multi-scale porous colloids possessing three length scales of 7, 2 and 0.7\,nm. The other block corresponds to protein chains that organize as Gaussian chains in solution and are prone to aggregation. A large array of polysaccharide/protein conjugates was identified, which differs in size, hydrophobicity and amino-acid content. Still, their structure is always the juxtaposition of the two building blocks structures. Additionally, small-angle neutron scattering reveals that large-scale structures are ubiquitous in Gum Arabic solutions and originate from the self-association of both free and conjugated polypeptide chains. Despite its compositional complexity, Gum Arabic solutions thus possess a robust multi-scale structure that is mainly impacted by concentration and ionic repulsions.},

Although FCCS is closely related to two-color confocal microscopy, critical adjustments and test measurements are necessary to establish successful FCCS measurements, which are described in a step-by-step manner. Moreover, we discuss control experiments for a negative cross-correlation artifact, arising from a lack of detection volume overlap, and a positive artifact, arising from cross-talk. FCCS has been applied to follow molecular interactions in solutions, on membranes and in cells and to analyze dynamic colocalization during intracellular transport. It is a technique that is expected to see new applications in various fields of biochemical and cell biological research.},

There is no need for external stimulation or pumping of the liquid, due to the fact that the dewetting process, an internal mechanism, acts as a driving force for liquid flow. Viscous dissipation, within the liquid, and slippage balance interfacial forces. Thus, friction at the solid/liquid interface plays a key role towards the flow dynamics of the liquid. Probing the temporal and spatial evolution of growing holes or retracting straight fronts gives, in combination with theoretical models, information on the liquid flow field and, especially, the boundary condition at the interface. We review the basic models and experimental results obtained during the last several years with exclusive regard to polymers as ideal model liquids for fluid flow. Moreover, concepts that aim to explain slippage on the molecular scale are summarized and discussed.},

We conclude from X-ray scattering and relaxation spectroscopy data for higher poly(n-alkyl acrylates) (PnAA) and poly(n-alkyl methacrylates) (PnAMA) that alkyl groups of different monomeric units aggregate in the melt and form self-assembled alkyl nanodomains with a typical size of 0.5\textendash 2 nm. A comparison with data for other polymer series having alkyl groups reveals that important structural and dynamic aspects are main-chain independent. A polyethylene-like glass transition within the alkyl nanodomains is observed and discussed in the context of a hindered glass transition in self-assembled confinements. This is an interesting link between central questions in glass-transition research and structural aspects in nanophase-separated materials.},

The present chapter will focus on the latter and will show how robust and powerful models of statistical mechanics of liquids are able to relate the scattering intensity to the microscopic pair potential of interaction between spherical particles and to allow intensive treatment of experimental data. More ambitious studies which involve the details of the supporting medium (discreteness of the ions or of the solvent molecules) or the presence of anisotropic particles (rods, plates . . . ) requires heavier treatments which will be briefly surveyed at the end of the chapter.},

This is achieved by measuring the chain form factor by small-angle neutron scattering using the zero average contrast method (ZAC). Polymer concentrations 0.17 and 0.34 M correspond in our case to the semidilute regime or its limit with dilute regime depending on the chain conformation. The main result is the monitoring with added THF of the pearl necklace conformation. This heterogeneous structure, made of wormlike chain parts (strings) and pearls, was observed formerly in water: when f decreases, the string contribution decreases, and the pearls size, characterized by a maximum in Kratky q2S1(q) representation, slightly increases. Here we see that in the presence of increasing content of added THF (i) the pearls contribution decreases, as expected, and (ii) their size does not change by more than 10\% in most cases (30\% at the most). Among different modeling, the most complete has been done following the pearl necklace models of Schweins, Huber et al. and Lages, Huber et al.; beyond the size and distribution of pearls, it addresses the radius of gyration, the correlation distance between spheres, weakly visible, and, importantly their number N. The values of Rg, as well as the modeling, suggest that while the sphere size varies a few, N decreases clearly with added good solvent. A link with the simulation of Liao et al. can be found. A second result, important in practice, is that all modeling of the scattering establishes that THF addition makes vanish an excess of low q scattering due to large compact spheres present in water. A third result is obtained after a ``THF treatment'' procedure, consisting of adding THF and then removing it by evaporation: (i) the spherical aggregates are washed out, and (ii) the pearl necklace conformation of the chain returns to the one in water solution before treatment. Therefore, the pearl necklace conformation of the hydrophobic polyelectrolyte in aqueous solution appears to be in an annealed equilibrium state resulting from hydrophobic attraction and electrostatic repulsion.},

AUC directly measures the density of nanoparticle\textendash polymer conjugates while TOC provides the total carbon content of its aqueous dispersions. When these techniques are applied to model gold nanoparticles capped with thiolated poly(ethylene glycol), the measured grafting densities across a range of polymer chain lengths, polymer concentrations, and nanoparticle diameters agree to within 20\%. Moreover, the measured grafting densities correlate well with the polymer content determined by thermogravimetric analysis of solid conjugate samples. Using these tools, we examine the particle core diameter, polymer chain length, and polymer solution concentration dependence of nanoparticle grafting densities in a gold nanoparticle\textendash poly(ethylene glycol) conjugate system.},

Other very promising areas which depend on the interaction between IL molecules and material surfaces are the use of ILs in the lubrication of microelectromechanic and nanoelectromechanic systems (MEMS and NEMS), the friction and wear reduction of reactive light alloys and the modification of nanophases.},

As shear is applied to a disordered micellar solution, the transition shows up in steady-shear experiments as a kink in the shear stress behaviour. Using small-angle neutron scattering under shear, we show that beyond the transition rate, a nematic phase manifests itself by the growth of crescentlike scattering patterns in the direction perpendicular to the flow. A dynamical phase diagram is finally proposed for this system of equilibrium polymers.},

  abstract = {Microscopic dynamical events control many of the physical processes at play in condensed matter: transport, magnetism, catalysis and even function of biological assemblies. Inelastic (INS) and Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) are irreplaceable probes of these phenomena. These experimental techniques reveal the displacements of atoms and molecules over distances spanning from angstroms to a few tens of nanometers, on time scales ranging from a fraction of picoseconds to microseconds. In this context, the different INS and QENS machines (Time-of-Flight (ToF), Backscattering (BS) and Neutron spin-echo (NSE)) stand at a central position. After introducing an underlying basic theoretical toolbox for neutron scattering, the principles and key elements of a ToF measurement are described. While, here, we mainly focus on disk choppers spectrometers, all the INS/QENS instruments share a common ground: they directly and simultaneously probe correlation functions in both time and space, so that the scattering vector (Q) dependence of the systems characteristic time(s) can be measured. To illustrate, the potentialities of the technique in the field of soft-matter, we show a multiscale approach of the dynamics of a polymer melt. The system is probed from the molecular to the mesoscopic scale (1 ps to 0.6 \textmu s and 0.1 to 40 nm), in bulk and under nanometric confinement. We address the different dynamical modes of a high mass entangled polymer chain: local monomer dynamics, Rouse modes up to the reptation process. This study exemplifies that, used in conjunction with hydrogen/deuterium isotopic effects, high resolution QENS can be bridged to the Zero Average Contrast (ZAC) method to probe, in a non destructive way, the dynamics of a single polymer chain in bulk but also under severe nanometric confinement. Connection and complementarity of the neutron derived analysis with Pulsed-Field Gradient and Relaxation NMR techniques are discussed.},

Using two rheometers we measure the apparent viscosity over more than five decades of shear rate to determine the Newtonian viscosity and the onset of shear thinning, which is inversely proportional to the relaxation time. We study five decades of polyelectrolyte concentration, from the dilute to the entangled regimes, and three decades of added salt (NaCl) concentration, on a single polyelectrolyte sample. Much of the viscosity data in the literature are shown to be in the shear thinning regime and are not indicative of the Newtonian viscosity. Our data for viscosity and longest relaxation time are qualitatively consistent with a recent scaling theory. There are systematic deviations from this simple theory, including the failure of the well-established Fuoss law, which is shown to be obeyed by the apparent viscosity only at higher shear rates.},

With the choice of an appropriate model a fit to the reflectivity curve can be undertaken to determine the parameters of the stack. The Fourier analysis method can only be used if the reflectivity data undergo a transformation to produce a periodic curve. Associated artifacts are studied and discussed.

PILs were synthesized from N-alkyl quaternized poly(4-vinylpyridine) P-4VP+-CnBr- with different alkyl chain length, n = 2, 4, 5 and different molecular weights (60.000 and 160.000 g/mol). The systems obtained were compared with the polyelectrolyte of origin, i.e., the N-alkyl quaternized poly(4-vinylpyridine). The molecular characterization of PILs was obtained by FT-IR, 1H NMR and 19F NMR. Moreover, the thermal analysis of these systems was by carried out by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TGA) techniques. Thermal degradation profiles obtained from TGA measurements, varied according to the alkyl chain length, which in turn influenced the obtained values of glass transition temperature (Tg), due to greater or lesser segmental movement of the alkyl chain. The results obtained for the PILs studied were analysed according to alkyl chain length, molecular weight and counter-anion effects. Additionally, P-4VP+-C4 BF4- was used in a preliminary study of chromium (VI) removal from aqueous solution, showing a 72.2\% removal of Cr (VI).},

  abstract = {A comb-like liquid crystal polymer is stretched and quenched after a certain time in the nematic phase. The conformation of the deformed chain is determined using small angle neutron scattering (SANS) as a function of the temperature of stretching, the stretching ratio and the duration of the relaxation. The scattering data are well fitted to junction affine and phantom network models. Some data are even well fitted by a totally affine model that we call `` pseudo affine '' because the only parameter, the stretching ratio, is found to be well below the macroscopic stretching ratio. The latter result, never encountered with amorphous polymers, is attributed to the cooperative effects of the nematic phase. We also note that the form factors of the chain in the underformed sample remain similar in the isotropic, nematic and glassy state ; they correspond to a Gaussian chain. The same samples were studied by wide angle X-ray scattering. On one hand, the orientation of the mesogenic groups is found to be parallel or perpendicular to the stretching direction depending on the stretching temperature. This result is discussed as a function of the presence of smectic fluctuations. On the other hand, longer relaxations at constant elongation ratio do not lead to a disorganization of the mesogenic group orientation whereas the polymer chains are partly relaxed.},

Examination of numerical results shows that the scattering functions for models (1) and (2) are not very different. The function for case (3) is somewhat different from the others when the mean number of branches per molecule is small but they contain a large fraction of the mass of the molecule. Over a limited range of the pertinent variables (corresponding roughly to observations on typical vinyl polymers of molecular weights up to 106) all three functions agree quite well with P(\texttheta ) for homogeneous linear chains with the same mean-square radius of gyration.},

This might be balanced by an attractive interaction with the pore walls. We found that the hydrogen-bonding polymer, poly(isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM), diffused readily through narrow pores in polycarbonate track-etched membranes. The trans side accumulation of pNIPAM followed a stretched exponential behavior. By contrast, a much smaller dextran diffused at a comparable or slower rate and showed ordinary Fick-like behavior. Comparison between the influence of pNIPAM surface adsorption and chemical grafting to the pores points to weak interpolymeric bonds as the source for the transport-accelerating surface interactions. We interpret the results as evidence for anomalous diffusion of pNIPAM inside the pores.},

The membrane pores were modified by graft polymerizing vinyl pyrrolidone onto the membrane pore surface, resulting in a polymer surface layer of covalently tethered polymer chains. The hydraulic permeability of the modified membrane increased with increasing transmembrane pressure owing to flow-induced deformation of the grafted polymer chains. The dynamics of the modified pores was investigated by membrane hydraulic permeability studies along with a two-region hydrodynamic pore flow model. The thickness of the grafted polymer layer decreased with increasing pore-wall shear rate by up to about 47\%, relative to the thickness at the zero shear limit, depending on the surface density and length of the grafted chains. Although the effective pore size of the polymer-grafted membrane was reduced by 5\textendash 36\% (at the zero shear rate limit), about 18\textendash 59\% of the pore size loss was regained at high pore-wall shear rates. Increasing the degree of shear-induced permeability change is feasible by increasing the ratio of the polymer chain length/pore size ratio as well as the surface density of the grafted polymer phase. The present results suggest that hydrodynamic pore size control could provide an additional useful degree of freedom in operating polymer-modified filtration membranes.},

Whereas this phenomenon has been explored extensively for planar solid substrates, its presence in nanostructured geometries has barely been studied so far, despite its importance for many natural and technological fluid transport processes. Here we use porous photonic crystals in silicon to resolve by light interferometry capillarity-driven spreading of liquid fronts in pores of few nanometers in radius. Upon spatiotemporal rescaling the fluid profiles collapse on master curves indicating that all imbibition fronts follow a square-root-of-time broadening dynamics. For the simple liquid (glycerol) a sharp front with a widening typical of Lucas-Washburn capillary-rise dynamics in a medium with pore-size distribution occurs. By contrast, for a polymer (PDMS) a precursor film moving ahead of the main menisci entirely alters the nature of the nanoscale transport, in agreement with predictions of computer simulations.},

  abstract = {The observation of fluorescence in the visible spectral range in imidazolium-based ionic liquids, in which the peak of the fluorescence spectrum shifts with the change in the excitation wavelength by over 200 nm, was reported by Samanta and co-workers (Paul et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109, 9148; Chem. Phys. Lett. 2005, 402, 375), and the aggregate structure in the bulk ionic liquid was suggested to explain this unique phenomenon. In this work, by employing 2D-scan fluorescence spectroscopy, we identified the long- and short-wavelength fluorescence components of the fluorescence spectrum of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C4MIM][BF4]), of which only the long-wavelength fluorescence component was found to be responsible for the reported fluorescence properties. The fluorescence intensity of the long-wavelength component decreased much faster upon dilution in aqueous mixtures than the short-wavelength component, supporting the conclusion that the long-wavelength fluorescence is from molecular aggregates in the bulk ionic liquid. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which was used to accurately account for the number density of the long-wavelength fluorescent species in aqueous solutions of the ionic liquid, also suggested that the fluorescence came from aggregate structures of molecules in ionic liquids.},

  abstract = {\textsection{} 1. It was shown by Bothe and Becker that some light elements when bombarded by {$\alpha$}-particles of polonium emit radiations which appear to be of the {$\gamma$}-ray type. The element beryllium gave a particularly marked effect of this kind, and later observations by Bothe, by Mme. Curie-Joliot and by Webster showed that the radiation excited in beryllium possessed a penetrating power distinctly greater than that of any {$\gamma$}-radiation yet found from the radioactive elements. In Webster's experiments the intensity of the radiation was measured both by means of the Geiger-M\"uller tube counter and in a high pressure ionisation chamber. He found that the beryllium radiation had an absorption coefficient in lead of about 0{$\cdot$}22 cm.-1 as measured under his experimental conditions. Making the necessary corrections for these conditions, and using the results of Gray and Tarrant to estimate the relative contributions of scattering, photoelectric absorption, and nuclear absorption in the absorption of such penetrating radiation, Webster concluded that the radiation had a quantum energy of about 7 \texttimes{} 106 electron volts. Similarly he found that the radiation from boron bombarded by {$\alpha$}-particles of polonium consisted in part of a radiation rather more penetrating than that from beryllium, and he estimated the quant um energy of this component as about 10 X 106 electron volts. These conclusions agree quite well with the supposition that the radiations arise by the capture of the {$\alpha$}-particle into the beryllium (or boron) nucleus and the emission of the surplus energy as a quantum of radiation. The radiations showed, however, certain peculiarities, and at my request the beryllium radiation was passed into an expansion chamber and several photographs were taken. No unexpected phenomena were observed though, as will be seen later, similar experiments have now revealed some rather striking events. The failure of these early experiments was partly due to the weakness of the available source of polonium, and partly to the experimental arrangement, which, as it now appears, was not very suitable.},

However, despite the possibility to control the desired nonequilibrium properties of polymers, a rigorous microscopic understanding of the processing\textendash property relations is currently lacking. In an attempt to stimulate progress along this topical direction, we focus here on three prototypical and apparently different cases: spin-coated polymer films, rapidly drawn polymer fibers, and sheared polymer melts. Inspired by the presence of common observations in the chosen cases, we search for order parameters as, for example, topological correlations and heterogeneities, which may allow characterizing the processing-induced behavior of polymers. We highlight that such approaches, necessitating concerted efforts from theory, simulations, and experiments, can provide a profound understanding leading to predictable and tunable properties of polymers.},

The decrease in Tg shows exactly the same trend before and after sc-CO2 exposure plus thermal treatment.

  abstract = {Anode aluminum oxide (AAO) porous materials have been widely used in ionic translocation for many biological and chemical studies. However, the lack of stimuli-response of this material limits its applications for the precise control of ionic transportation by the external environment. In this study, we functionalized the internal nanopores of AAO membranes to generate polyelectrolyte-filled pH-responsive membranes whose ionic conductivity could be readily controlled by changing the pH value. AAO membranes with different pore sizes (25, 75 and 100 nm) were modified with poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) by a ``grafting-to'' approach. Thermogravimetric and SEM analysis revealed that the extent of PMAA infiltration strongly depends upon the relative sizes of the nanopores and the PMAA concentration. Increasing the size of the nanopores enables the infiltration of PAA solution with a higher concentration. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that the membrane conductivity decreases from 7.87 \texttimes{} 10-4 S cm-1 at pH 1 to 5.72 \texttimes{} 10-5 S cm-1 at pH 7. The functionalized AAO nanopores showed significant sensitivity to pH value, whereas a valve effect was observed in the pH range between 4 and 5. Our fabricated PMAA-AAO membranes show promising potential to be used as pH sensors and smart valves in micro-/nano-total analysis chips for biomedical and chemical applications.},

This analysis revealed a value of C{$\infty$} {$\sim$} 5\textendash 7, beyond which lint increases substantially with C{$\infty$}. Moreover, lint grows upon approaching the glass transition temperature from above, and the rate of this growth seems to correlate with polymer fragility. Most important, our analysis revealed that lint is comparable to the characteristic length scale of dynamic heterogeneities in the studied materials. These results provide new understandings of molecular parameters controlling the interfacial layer and are important not only for the field of polymer nanocomposites but also for the fields of thin polymer films and dynamics of soft matter in general.},

Two scattering functions of semiflexible chains incorporating excluded volume effects, with and without the intermicellar interactions, were used in SANS data model fitting. Two needed changes were made in the well-accepted models. Extensive and systematic SANS data analysis suggests the robustness of these corrected scattering functions when the intermicellar interactions are included. The influence of the headgroups and ionic strength on the contour length and micellar flexibility of these two systems was demonstrated on the basis of the quantitative structural information obtained from the model fitting. Micellar flexibility was found to depend on surfactant concentration, even when intermicellar interactions were taken into account, despite predictions to the contrary.},

The separation of the axial and confined lateral diffusion dynamics provides an opportunity to study diffusions in different dimensions separately. We further experimentally studied 45 nm carboxylated polystyrene particles diffusing in 300 nm alumina pores. The experimental data showed consistency with the simulation. To extract the accurate axial diffusion coefficient, we found that a 1D diffusion model with a Lorentzian axial collection profile needs to be used to analyze the experimental ACFs. The diffusion of the 45 nm nanoparticles in polyethyleneglycol-passivated 300 nm pores slowed down by a factor of {$\sim$}2, which can be satisfactorily explained by hydrodynamic frictions.},

Notre objectif a \'et\'e d'\'etudier la conformation et la dynamique de ces cha\^ines greff\'ees lorsque ces derni\`eres sont soumises \`a diff\'erents types de sollicitations afin de comprendre les m\'ecanismes mol\'eculaires r\'egissant les propri\'et\'es d'adh\'esion et de friction de ce type d'interface. Dans un premier volet, nous avons \'etudi\'e par r\'eflectivit\'e de neutrons la cin\'etique de cicatrisation d'une interface compos\'ee initialement de cha\^ines greff\'ees recroquevill\'ees sur un substrat et en contact avec un fondu. Lorsque le syst\`eme est amen\'e \`a une temp\'erature sup\'erieure \`a la temp\'erature de transition vitreuse, les cha\^ines de polym\`ere retrouvent une mobilit\'e non nulle permettant ainsi la p\'en\'etration des cha\^ines greff\'ees dans le fondu de polym\`ere. La r\'eflectivit\'e de neutrons nous a permis d'une part de sonder \`a l'\'echelle mol\'eculaire la cin\'etique de cicatrisation de ce type d'interface et d'autre part de la quantifier. L'influence des param\`etres mol\'eculaires sur cette cin\'etique de cicatrisation a pu \^etre observ\'ee, ce qui nous a permis de proposer un mod\`ele en loi d'\'echelle permettant d'apporter une interpr\'etation physique au ph\'enom\`ene \'etudi\'e. La deuxi\`eme partie de ce travail de th\`ese a consist\'e en l'\'elaboration d'un dispositif exp\'erimental permettant de cisailler un syst\`eme brosse/fondu au-dessus de la temp\'erature de la temp\'erature transition vitreuse et de geler la conformation des cha\^ines greff\'ees dans leur configuration cisaill\'ee. L'inversion des spectres de r\'eflectivit\'e neutrons associ\'es a permis de mettre en \'evidence l'influence du cisaillement sur le degr\'e d'interp\'en\'etration entre la brosse et le fondu qui r\'egit la transmission des contraintes de friction sur ce type d'interface. De plus, nous avons pu mesurer la cin\'etique de relaxation de cha\^ines greff\'ees, cisaill\'ees au pr\'ealable, et la comparer aux exp\'eriences d'interdigitation simple. Cette comparaison a permis de divulguer l'importance du type de sollicitation sur la cin\'etique de relaxation d'une interface brosse / fondu.Nous avons \'egalement observ\'e que la cin\'etique de relaxation et la conformation de cha\^ines greff\'ees peuvent \^etre alt\'er\'ees lorsque ces derni\`eres sont confin\'ees dans un film d'\'epaisseur comparable au rayon de giration des cha\^ines. Une \'etude syst\'ematique par r\'eflectivit\'e de neutrons a permis de mettre en \'evidence une acc\'el\'eration de la cin\'etique de relaxation du syst\`eme en dessous d'une \'epaisseur critique qui pourrait \^etre interpr\'et\'ee en termes de d\'eplacement de la temp\'erature de transition vitreuse. Dans un deuxi\`eme temps, nous avons \'etudi\'e le glissement de solutions de polym\`eres sur une surface greff\'ee. La fraction volumique en cha\^ines libres dans la solution est un param\`etre suppl\'ementaire aux trois cas pr\'ec\'edents qui contr\^ole ici le degr\'e d'interp\'en\'etration entre cha\^ines libres et cha\^ines greff\'ees. Une premi\`ere approche th\'eorique a permis de dissocier diff\'erents r\'egimes de glissements \`a la paroi en fonction de fraction volumique. Nous avons entrepris une premi\`ere s\'erie d'exp\'eriences de v\'elocim\'etrie laser apr\`es photolyse afin de mesurer le glissement \`a la paroi de solutions de polym\`ere et de confronter les r\'esultats exp\'erimentaux avec notre approche th\'eorique.},

The segment density profile of the grafted chains was measured for different annealing times. The kinetics of relaxation was quantified by measuring the amount of melt chains that have crossed the initial h-PS/d-PS sharp interface as a function of the annealing time. The dependence of this kinetics versus the molecular weight of the grafted chains, the melt chains, and the grafting density is investigated and compared to a proposed scaling model inspired from the previous work of Milner, McLeish, and O'Connor.1,2 Moreover, the relaxation kinetics is found to highly depend on the polydispersity of the polymer brushes, and we propose a way for taking that parameter into account.},

  abstract = {Polymer-grafted nanopores are used in several nanotechnological applications which demand control of structural and hydration properties of the grafted polymers. By means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the chain length and grafting density effects on the conformation and hydration of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) grafted to gold nanopores of different radii. We find that if the pore size exceeds the polymer length, increasing the grafting density or chain length for a given pore results in conformational changes of the polymer from pancake-like shapes to well-hydrated overlapping mushrooms to a denser less hydrated polymer brush. We demonstrate that an increase of pore curvature results in considerable polymer crowding within the pore, which translates into an increase of the effective grafting density, {$\sigma$}eff, which has to be taken into consideration when concave nanopores and planar and convex surfaces are compared. We show that for a given polymer grafting density and chain length, a decrease in the pore radius R results in an increased radial orientation, and for a low grafting density, there is a slight increase of the grafted layer height H until the polymer chains fill the pore (R {$\sim$} H) and start folding near the pore surface, conforming into a cone-shape with a further brush height decrease until the high-density limit is reached. The properties of polymer-grafted nanopores, such as water exchange and gating capability, depend on the polymer conformation and hydration, which are strongly influenced by the polymer grafting density and differ for polymer-filled and open nanopores.},

In this study, an ionic liquid monomer was synthesized and polymerized into random copolymers and their ionic conductivity and structure were investigated as a function of copolymer composition. Both nonionic-ionic and ionic-ionic copolymers were synthesized, where the nonionic and ionic monomers were hexyl methacrylate (HMA) and a methacrylate-based imidizolium neutralized with tetrafluoroborate (BF4) or bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (TFSI). In the nonionic-ionic copolymer, the ionic conductivity increased by over an order of magnitude with increasing HMA composition, even though the overall charge content decreased, because the addition of HMA significantly lowered the glass transition temperature. The ionic conductivity also increased by more than an order of magnitude in the ionic-ionic copolymer with increasing TFSI content, even though there was no change in the overall charge content, because substituting the larger anion TFSI for BF4 resulted in weaker ionic interactions and also significantly lowered the glass transition temperature. In both types of copolymers, the temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity was well described by both Arrhenius and Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher models. An important difference between the two classes of random copolymers was that the nonionic-ionic copolymer exhibited microphase separation in X-ray scattering that correlated with a discontinuity in the increasing ionic conductivity with increasing HMA content suggesting that structure can also play a significant role in ion transport in polymerized ionic liquids.},

At low Mw, the effective viscosity of the nanometer thin films is smaller than the bulk and decreases with decreasing h0. This is due to enhancement of the total shear flow by the augmented mobility at the free surface. As Mw increases, with h0 becoming smaller than the polymer radius of gyration (Rg), the effective viscosity switches from being substrate-independent to substrate-dependent. We propose that interfacial slippage then dominates and leads to plug flow. The friction coefficient is found to increase with h0 providing h0/Rg {$<$} {$\sim$}1, demonstrating a surface-promoted confinement effect.},

In the entangled regime, the tracer diffusion coefficients (D) of TiO2 decrease as the M\textendash 1.4, whereas the CM predicts DCM {$\sim$} M\textendash 3.0 using the measured zero-shear viscosity of TiO2(1 vol \%): PS(M) blends. By plotting D/DCM versus M/Me, where Me is the entanglement molecular weight, diffusion is enhanced by a factor of 10\textendash 103 as M/Me increases. The faster diffusion is attributed to decoupling of nanorod diffusion from polymer relaxations in the surrounding matrix, which is facilitated by the nanorod dimensions (i.e., L greater than and d less than the entanglement mesh size, 8 nm).},

In both settings, the suspending (liquid) and suspended (solid) phases are normally distinct and uncoupled on long length and time scales. In this study, we report on the synthesis and physical properties of a novel family of covalently grafted nanoparticles that exist as self-suspended suspensions with high particle loadings. In such suspensions, we find that the grafted polymer chains exhibit unusual multiscale structural transitions and enhanced conformational stability on subnanometer and nanometer length scales. On mesoscopic length scales, the suspensions display exceptional homogeneity and colloidal stability. We attribute this feature to steric repulsions between grafted chains and the space-filling constraint on the tethered chains in the single-component self-suspended materials, which inhibits phase segregation. On macroscopic length scales, the suspensions exist as neat fluids that exhibit soft glassy rheology and, counterintuitively, enhanced elasticity with increasing temperature. This feature is discussed in terms of increased interpenetration of the grafted chains and jamming of the nanoparticles.},

  abstract = {Nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) is a well-known nanoporous material with multiple applications. In the last years new experimental strategies have been developed to produce AAO in order to tune the pore morphology or ordering and discuss its growth mechanism. Here we describe an original approach to synthesize AAOs using deuterated electrolytes (i.e. sulfuric or oxalic acids in deuterated water D2O) leading to a pore diameter reduction of around 20 \% and an increase in the pore ordering and pore growth. Better pore ordering in D2O is correlated to an increase in anion incorporation during the synthesis and the growth rate improvement is related to a decrease in the activation energy of the alumina formation. Moreover, the use of deuterated species allows to discuss the incorporation of hydroxyl groups during the AAO synthesis or the hydration after im\- mersion in H2O or D2O by Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS), a technique sensitive to deuteration. SANS reveals no changes between AAOs synthesized in H2O or D2O due to OH incorporation but shows differences after a long immersion time in water (H2O or D2O), indicating that the hydration is a slow process. This work shows that the use of deuterium is an interesting alternative for the synthesis of AAOs with well-controlled and specific morphologies and, from a fundamental point of view, can bring new general understanding about AAOs formation.},

  abstract = {It remains a great experimental challenge to obtain quantitative information on the polyelectrolyte (PE) behavior confined in charged nanoporous materials. Here, we propose an original approach using transverse streaming potential measurements (TSPMs), an efficient technique providing information on the electrical surface properties of nanoporous materials through the {$\zeta$}-potential determination. We conduct TSPMs within the thin double-layer approximation on a model system composed of individual nanochannels, a nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane, filled with a well-known PE,~sodium polystyrenesulfonate (NaPSS). We demonstrate that TSPMs can provide the AAO {$\zeta$}-potential under different experimental conditions and monitor the PE penetration in AAO with positive or negative surface charge. On the positive surface, the PE irreversibly adsorbs, while it does not when the surface is negatively charged, indicating the electrostatic nature of the PE adsorption. In the context of experimental limitations to investigate PE behavior on concave surfaces, this study shows that the TSPM is suitable to extract quantitative information and can be exploited to gain an understanding of the PE adsorption and desorption in a confined medium.},

The probe-tethered polymers grafted onto the polymer\textendash substrate interface provide spatial selectivity to probe only the segmental dynamics of polymer near the polymer\textendash substrate interface. The perturbation caused by the grafted polymer chains on the segmental dynamics of the polymer film near the interface was minimized by reducing the molecular weight of the polymer brush compared with the critical entanglement molecular weight of the polymer and grafted with a low grafting density ({$\approx$}0.1 chains/nm2) using a ``grafting-to'' method, which allows precisely controlled and fully characterized polymer brush structures. In addition, the molecular weight of the brush polymer was further controlled to {$\approx$}10 kg/mol with the root-mean-square end-to-end distance of {$\approx$}5 nm to probe dynamics within 10 nm of the polymer\textendash substrate interface. Polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) films carrying rather unfavorable and similar surface energies, respectively, with the silane-modified silicon wafer substrates were investigated. The polymer dynamics near the interface characterized by the degrees of non-Arrhenius temperature dependence and nonexponential relaxation were not altered in both systems compared with those of the bulk, suggesting that the polymer dynamics is not sensitive to moderate differences in enthalpic interaction between the polymer and the substrate.},

Dans ce travail de th\`ese, nous nous sommes int\'eress\'es \`a l'identification des m\'ecanismes mol\'eculaires de la friction aux interfaces polym\`eres souples. Dans ce contexte, nous avons r\'ealis\'e deux \'etudes compl\'ementaires. La premi\`ere partie du travail concerne le mouvement d'une ligne triple solide-liquide-vapeur qui se d\'eplace sur une surface solide sous l'effet de diff\'erentes forces (gravit\'e, forces capillaires et tensions interfaciales), et en particulier le lien entre le pi\'egeage et le d\'epi\'egeage de la ligne triple et l'hyst\'er\`ese de l'angle de contact. Cette m\'ethode permet de mesurer des angles de contact d'avanc\'ee et de recul\'ee avec une pr\'ecision sans pr\'ec\'edent (0,1\textdegree )et s'av\`ere \^etre particuli\`erement sensible aux m\'ecanismes qui tendent \`a ancrer la ligne triple.

Nous avons montr\'e que le comportement en friction de cette couche confin\'ee suit exactement le comportement rh\'eofluidifiant observ\'e pour des couches de fondu de masses molaires \'equivalentes mais avec un temps de relaxation beaucoup plus long que celui des cha\^ines en fondu,la reptation n'\'etant pas permise pour les cha\^ines ancr\'ees. Enfin, en comparant les r\'esultats obtenus pour des couches greff\'ees chimiquement \`a une extr\'emit\'e et des couches fortement adsorb\'ees, ayant par ailleurs les m\^emes caract\'eristiques mol\'eculaires (masse molaire des cha\^ines et \'epaisseur de la couche ancr\'ee), nous avons mis en \'evidence que la friction est remarquablement sensible \`a l'organisation mol\'eculaire au sein de la couche ancr\'ee.},

First, thiol-ene coupling between 6-mercapto-1-hexanol and vinyl chain-ends allowed the formation of dihydroxy-terminated PDMS telechelics through the formation of a thioether linkage. The resulting material was then sequentially fractionated using dichloromethane/methanol mixtures to afford several well-defined dihydroxy-terminated PDMS fractions having sharp distributions of molar masses (Mn = 99.5\textendash 158 kDa and \DJ{} {$<$} 1.2). The NBD fluorescent probes were then attached at both chain-ends by N,N{${'}$}-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/4-(dimethylamino)pyridine esterification coupling between the hydroxyl groups and 6-(7-nitrobenzofurazan-4-ylamino)hexanoic acid. The resulting fluorescent PDMS telechelics were characterized by SEC, 1H NMR, UV\textendash visible, and fluorescence spectroscopies. These materials are suitable probes to investigate the dynamics of polymer chains in bulk or at interfaces by the fringe pattern fluorescent recovery after photobleaching technique. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We aim to give an overview on the main features of the scattering curves, and discuss the structural information that can be drawn. We will first give the basics of small angle scattering and highlight the role played by neutron scattering and isotopic labeling. Thus, we will discuss the significance of the monomer and counterion partial scattering functions according to the scattering length densities of both components, and will emphasize the unique possibility to separate out the intra- and intermolecular correlations. Then, some examples will show how the dispersion state and the average conformation of macroions can be addressed.

They are unusual liquids, which challenge the classical frameworks of electrolytes, whose behaviour at electrified interfaces remains elusive, with exotic responses relevant to their electrochemical activity. Using tuning-fork-based atomic force microscope nanorheological measurements, we explore here the properties of confined RTILs, unveiling a dramatic change of the RTIL towards a solid-like phase below a threshold thickness, pointing to capillary freezing in confinement. This threshold is related to the metallic nature of the confining materials, with more metallic surfaces facilitating freezing. This behaviour is interpreted in terms of the shift of the freezing transition, taking into account the influence of the electronic screening on RTIL wetting of the confining surfaces. Our findings provide fresh views on the properties of confined RTIL with implications for their properties inside nanoporous metallic structures, and suggests applications to tune nanoscale lubrication with phase-changing RTILs, by varying the nature and patterning of the substrate, and application of active polarization.},

It is a versatile spectrometer with a horizontal geometry enabling air/liquid, air/solid and solid/liquid measurements. It is mostly dedicated to soft matter projects but welcomes also studies on thin solid films. It is equipped with a multi-disc chopper providing a tunable {$\delta\lambda$}/{$\lambda$} resolution, a collimation system with two deviating supermirrors and slits with flexible apertures allowing any given {$\delta\theta$}/\texttheta{} higher than 0.007, a large sample area, and a detector (either single tube or positioning sensitive detector). The accessible Q min is 0.0026 \AA -1 and the accessible Q max is 0.36 \AA -1 in air/solid or solid/liquid geometries and 0.21 \AA -1 in air/liquid geometry. The spectrometer has been upgraded during the last decade in order to reach a gain in flux of {$\sim$} 50 from its original version. In air/solid geometry, we reach R min = 2\texttimes 10-5 in 1 hour, R min = 8\texttimes 10-7 in 4 hours and R min = 4\texttimes 10-7 in 12 hours on a sample of {$\sim$} 20 cm2 with EROS II, while it was difficult to go below 10-5 with the initial version dating from 1992. In air/liquid or solid/liquid geometries, we show that the main limitation to reach very low reflectivities is the incoherent scattering of the liquid solvent (D2O) . For such geometries, we obtain R min of 5\texttimes 10-6 in 4 hours after incoherent background subtraction. The rejuvenated EROS allows thus measurements of 15-20 samples of a few tens cm2 in a span of 4 days, which corresponds to the minimum time allocated to external users for a given experiment.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate in this paper the possibilities offered by Grazing Incidence Small Angle Neutron Scattering (GISANS) for the study of solid/liquid interfaces. We present experimental results obtained by Specular Neutron Reflectivity (SNR) and GISANS on a model system made of silica nanospheres adsorbed on a silicon wafer by electrostatic interactions both at solid/air interface and solid/liquid interfaces. At the solid/liquid interface, we demonstrate that grazing incidence scattering enables to discriminate the surface and the bulk scattering. The surface structure factor derived from GISANS shows that the nanospheres are organized as a repulsive liquid system, with a surface fraction occupation consistent with values obtained by SNR. This original setup highlights a direct correlation between the structure of the silica nanospheres in solution and their organization on the surface: due to the strong electrostatic repulsions between spheres, their organization at the surface is close to the projection in 2D of the 3D organization of the nanospheres in solution.},

  abstract = {The morphology and ionic conductivity of poly(1-n-alkyl-3-vinylimidazolium)-based homopolymers polymerized from ionic liquids were investigated as a function of the alkyl chain length and counterion type. In general, X-ray scattering showed three features: (i) backbone-to-backbone, (ii) anion-to-anion, and (iii) pendant-to-pendant characteristic distances. As the alkyl chain length increases, the backbone-to-backbone separation increases. As the size of counterion increases, the anion-to-anion scattering peak becomes apparent and its correlation length increases. The X-ray scattering features shift to lower angles as the temperature increases due to thermal expansion. The ionic conductivity results show that the glass transition temperature (Tg) is a dominant, but not exclusive, parameter in determining ion transport. The Tg-independent ionic conductivity decreases as the backbone-to-backbone spacing increases. Further interpretation of the ionic conductivity using the Vogel\textendash Fulcher\textendash Tammann equation enabled the correlation between polymer morphology and ionic conductivity, which highlights the importance of anion hoping between adjacent polymer backbones. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Lorentz correction is used to correct the intensities of X-ray scattering of single crystal diffractometry in order to recalculate intensities to obtain structure factors. This correction reduces the intensities to zero at zero diffraction angle. Small angle scattering is used to study the dimensions of heterogeneities in polymeric materials. The scattering intensities near to zero scattering angle originate partly from periodic systems (reciprocal lattice) and partly from dispersed particle systems. Periodic systems should result in individual Gaussian or Lorentzian peaks with the position of a peak maximum depending on the length of the periodicity. Particle scattering results in a Gaussian peak centred at zero scattering angle. The effect of the Lorentz correction on the interpretation of small angle X-ray scattering data is shown in the case of some semicrystalline polyethylenes (high density, linear low density, and low molecular weight waxy polyethylenes). The data are compared with those for amorphous block copolymers (styrene/butadiene) in which there is a periodic system with homogeneous lamellar thickness. Lorentz correction destroys the characteristics of the particle scattering and can be applied only for periodic systems. It should not be used to produce a peak on scattering data which does not show periodicity (peaks) without correction. \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Chem. Soc. 2021, 143, 1474\textendash 1484). This proof-of-concept study utilized a semifluorinated specialty monomer (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate) to ensure high X-ray contrast relative to water. Herein, we extend this approach to emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in the presence or absence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 70 \textdegree C. Solution conductivity measurements for this anionic surfactant indicated a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 10.9 mM at this temperature. Thus, SDS was employed at either 1.0 or 20.0 mM, which corresponds to well below or well above its CMC. Postmortem analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy indicated MMA conversions of 93\textendash 95\% for these three formulations. We demonstrate that the X-ray contrast between water and PMMA is sufficiently large to produce high-quality scattering patterns during TR-SAXS experiments. Such patterns were fitted using a hard-sphere scattering model to monitor the evolution in particle diameter. This enabled (i) determination of the time point for the onset of nucleation and (ii) the evolution in particle size to be monitored during the MMA polymerization. The final particle diameters obtained from such TR-SAXS studies were consistent with postmortem DLS analyses, while TEM studies confirmed that near-monodisperse latex particles were formed. Micellar nucleation occurs within just 2 min when the SDS concentration is well above its CMC, resulting in a high particle number concentration and relatively small latex particles. In contrast, when SDS is either absent or present below its CMC, particle nuclei are formed by homogeneous nucleation over significantly longer time scales (14\textendash 15 min). In the latter case, adsorption of SDS onto nascent particles reduces their coagulation, giving rise to a larger number of smaller particles compared to the surfactant-free polymerization. However, the characteristic time required for the onset of nucleation is barely affected because this is mainly controlled by the kinetics of homogeneous polymerization of the relatively water-soluble MMA monomer within the aqueous phase. These results suggest that the aqueous emulsion polymerization of several other (meth)acrylic monomers, and perhaps also vinyl acetate, may be amenable to TR-SAXS studies.},

Among them, the need for a high density of fluorescent molecules, the measurement of the beam profile, and a knowledge of the photobleaching processes are of a crucial importance. The application of a planar fringe pattern of light both for the bleaching and the monitoring of the fluorescent molecules solves these three major difficulties. Brownian diffusion coefficients and flow velocities can be measured independently and are averaged over the whole fringe pattern volume. These transport coefficients are explored over the wide range of experimentally accessible distances (from an interfringe spacing 0.5-50 micron). The quantification of the mobile and immobile components is further simplified by scanning the fringe pattern and detecting only a modulated fluorescence recovery signal. The fringe pattern photobleaching method is particularly adapted to the measurements of diffusion coefficients and flow velocity of membrane components, as well as of cytoplasmic proteins. The theoretical results and the test experiments with fluorescent bovine serum albumin are described.},

The coffee\textemdash initially dispersed over the entire drop\textemdash becomes concentrated into a tiny fraction of it. Such ring deposits are common wherever drops containing dispersed solids evaporate on a surface, and they influence processes such as printing, washing and coating. Ring deposits also provide a potential means to write or deposit a fine pattern onto a surface. Here we ascribe the characteristic pattern of the deposition to a form of capillary flow in which pinning of the contact line of the drying drop ensures that liquid evaporating from the edge is replenished by liquid from the interior. The resulting outward flow can carry virtually all the dispersed material to the edge. This mechanism predicts a distinctive power-law growth of the ring mass with time\textemdash a law independent of the particular substrate, carrier fluid or deposited solids.

  abstract = {Recent experiments by the Lausanne group have measured the fracture energy GIC(t) for two identical polymer blocks put into close contact, during a certain healing time t, at a temperature slightly above the glass point. We discuss here the reptation processes associated with this healing: 1) One important parameter is the number p(t) of molecular bridges (1 cm2) established between the two sides during the time t. For t \&lt; Trep a scaling argument (confirmed by detailed calculations of Prager and Tirrell) gives p(t) {$\sim$} pmax (t/Trep)1/2 (where Trep is the terminal time determined by vis-coelastic data). 2) the contour length of the interdigitated chains l(t) is predicted to grow like L(t/Trep)1/2 (where L is the total chain length). 3) the relation between GIC and these parameters is complex, but in one naive model GIC increase like l(t), and is thus proportionnal to t1/2, as found in the experiments. 4) the special case of dissymetric interfaces A/B (where A and B are two compatible polymer species) is not yet fully understood.},

  abstract = {We construct first the equilibrium concentration profiles for a polymer solution near a solid wall (or near the free surface). The wall is characterized by a certain ``free energy of sticking'', ylt which is negative for adsorption and positive for a repulsive surface. We are concerned with the case where yi (per monomer) is small, but where the energy per chain is large. (1) For the attractive case (with a good solvent), we find a remarkable, self-similar form for the profile which is essentially independent of the bulk concentration. Most monomers are confined in a region of thickness D \textasciitilde{} | |``3/2. But the ``equivalent hydrodynamic thickness'', eH, is controlled by the longest loops and should scale like the coil size in solution, fiF. (2) We also extend these considerations to metastable adsorption. For instance, starting from the above situation, we assume that the polymer in solution is washed out, leaving an adsorption layer; then the solvent is cooled down to a point: the adsorption layer shrinks significantly. In particular, we predict that all large loops disappear. All results now depend on the sample history: if the layer would have been prepared by contact between a solvent and the wall, we would expect eH comparable to the solvent coil size. (3) For the repulsive case, the exponents describing the depletion layer had been constructed earlier through a tentative argument based on the osmotic pressure near the wall. We rederive these exponents here by a more direct scaling method. For all these cases, we construct the scaling form of the interfacial tension and check the associated Gibbs identities.},

The topological requirement that P cannot intersect any of the chains of G is taken into account by a rigorous procedure: The only motions allowed for the chain are associated with the displacement of certain ``defects'' along the chain. The main conclusions derived from this model are the following:(a) There are two characteristic times for the chain motion: One of them (Td) is the equilibration time for the defect concentration, and is proportional to M2. The other time (Tr) is the time required for complete renewal of the chain conformation, and is proportional to M3.(b) The over-all mobility and diffusion coefficients of the chain P are proportional to M-2.(c) At times t{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}Tr the mean square displacement of one monomer of P increases only like {$\langle$}(rt{$\mkern1mu-\mkern1mu$}r0)2{$\rangle\mkern1mu$} = {$\mkern1mu$}constt1/4.These results may also turn out to be useful for the (more difficult) problem of entanglement effects in unlinked molten polymers.},

However, to date little is known about the ion conduction mechanism for this class of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). Herein, we performed an in-depth characterization of a homologous series of 1-alkyl-3-vinylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide-derived homopolymers, i.e., p(CnVIm-TSI) with n = 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, serving as a model compound family. A particular focus was set on the interplay of the physicochemical properties, nanostructure, and ionic conductivity as well as on the impact of the additional incorporation of a lithium salt, LiTFSI. The results reveal that the nanostructure of these self-assembling poly(ILs) plays a decisive role for the ion conduction mechanism, allowing for a (partial) decoupling of charge transport and segmental relaxation of the polymer backbone.},

Chain length N and grafting density {$\sigma$} are varied over a wide range and the crossover from ``mushroom'' to ``brush'' behavior is studied for three pore diameters. The monomer density profile and the distribution of the free chain ends are computed and compared to the corresponding model of polymer brushes at flat substrates. It is found that there exists a regime of N and {$\sigma$} for large enough pore diameter where the brush height in the pore exceeds the brush height on the flat substrate, while for large enough N and {$\sigma$} (and small enough pore diameters) the opposite behavior occurs, i.e. the brush is compressed by confinement. These findings are used to discuss the corresponding theories on polymer brushes at concave substrates.

Understanding the structure\textendash property relationship on a molecular level is very important for guiding the design of PIL-based ER materials. In this paper, a family of (p-vinylbenzyl)trialkylammonium hexafluorophosphate-based PIL particles containing different length of substituent alkyl chains attached to immobile ammonium charged site is synthesized for especially understanding the size effect of side chains on ER property. To exclude the particle shape effect, the PIL particles are controlled to be monodisperse sphere-like morphology with a similar size. The ER property of PIL particles when dispersed in insulating oil is investigated and compared by temperature-modulated rheological test under external electric fields. The dielectric spectroscopy is finally performed to study the mechanism behind the size effect of side chains on the ER property of PIL particles. We demonstrate that the size of side chains on the charged site has a significant impact on the ER effect of PIL particles and the PIL particles with shorter side chains have stronger ER property but degraded temperature dependence, and this is related to the fact that the variation of side chain size alters the transport dynamic of mobile counterions and ion motion-induced interfacial polarization.},

Here, the scattering from water, specifically light water, was measured on the EQ-SANS instrument, a time-of-flight (TOF) SANS instrument located at the Spallation Neutron Source of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A significant inelastic process was observed in the TOF spectra of neutrons scattered from water. Analysis of the TOF spectra from the sample showed that the scattered neutrons have energies consistent with room-temperature thermal energies (\$ 20 meV) regardless of the incident neutron's energy. With the aid of Monte Carlo particle transport simulations, we conclude that the thermalization process within the sample results in faster neutrons that arrive at the detector earlier than expected based on the incident neutron energies.

  abstract = {High aspect-ratio nanopores of nearly cylindrical geometry were fabricated by irradiation of 20~{$\mu$}m thick polycarbonate (PC) foils with Pb ions followed by UV sensitization and etching in 5~M NaOH at 60~\textdegree C. Synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to study the morphology and size variation of the nanopores as a function of the etching time and ion fluence. The shape of the nanopores was found to be consistent with cylindrical pores with ends tapering off towards the two polymer surfaces in the last \textasciitilde 1.6~{$\mu$}m. The tapered structure of the nanopores in track-etched PC membranes was first observed more than 40 years ago followed by many other studies suggesting that the shape of nanopores in PC membranes deviates from a perfect cylinder and nanopores narrow towards both membrane surfaces. It was also reported that the transport properties of the nanopore membranes are influenced by the tapered structure. However, quantification of the shape of nanopores has remained elusive due to inherent difficulties in imaging the pores using microscopy techniques. The present manuscript reports on the quantitative measurement of the tapered structure of nanopores using SAXS. Determination of this structure was enabled by obtaining high quality SAXS data and the development of appropriate fitting models. The etch rates for both the radius at the polymer surface and the radius of the pore in bulk were calculated. Both etch rates decrease slightly with increasing fluence. This behavior is ascribed to the overlap of track halos which are characterized by cross-linking of the polymer chains. The halo radius was estimated to be approximately 120~nm. The influence of the observed nanopore shape on the pore transport properties was estimated and found to have a significant influence on the water flow rates compared to cylindrical pores. The results enable a better understanding of track-etched membranes and facilitate improved pore design for many applications.},

  abstract = {The supramolocular structure of hemoglobin S has been studied by electron microscopy and computer-based image reconstruction. Negatively stained fibers prepared by the lysis of sickled cells or the stirring of hemoglobin S hemolysates have been observed to be almost exclusively of the 20-nm diameter form. These fibers have a periodic variation in diameter between the extremes of 18 nm and 23 nm. Computed Fourier transforms of the fibers show a, highly complex pattern of reciprocal space maxima, with 30 maxima on 20 layer-lines clearly resolved. The Bessel orders of the maxima were assigned with the aid of a newly developed technique, a combined real-space Fourier-space reconstruction method (REFORM). This method utilizes the filtered image produced by the inverse Fourier transform of the low-resolution maxima to calculate in real space the crosssection of a helical fiber. The REFORM analysis indicated that the fibers have an elliptical cross-section and are composed of 14 hexagonally packed filaments with 10 outer filaments surrounding four inner filaments. On the basis of this cross-section, the Bessel orders of all the maxima were assigned, permitting the calculation of three-dimensional reconstructions by Fourier Bessel synthesis. From these reconstructions details of the location of hemoglobin S molecules of each filament were obtained. Hemoglobin S molecules are staggered in adjacent filaments to produce a closely packed helical structure. Reconstructions of fibers at various stages of disassembly revealed a stable intermediate containing 10 filaments which could be characterized in terms of the loss of two pairs of specific outer filaments. A partially disassembled fiber with only six filaments at positions corresponding to three inner and three outer filaments of the parent structure was also identified. The six-filament structure appears to be produced from the 10-filament structure by the loss of two specific pairs of filaments. Thus pairs of filaments are evidently significant structural units in the stabilization of the complete fibers and the orientation of the molecules in these pairs may be related to the filament pairs known to occur in crystals of hemoglobin S.},

While the structure and transport of bulk PEMs for fuel cell applications have been studied extensively, much less is known about these materials at interfaces and under confinement, conditions that are highly relevant in the membrane electrode assembly of a working PEM fuel cell. Using X-ray reflectivity, neutron reflectivity, grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering, quartz crystal microbalance, and polarization-modulation infrared reflection\textendash absorption spectroscopy, we have studied the structure, swelling, water solubility, and water transport kinetics as a function of relative humidity for confined polyelectrolyte films thinner than 222 nm. While the humidity-dependent equilibrium swelling ratio, volumetric water fraction, and effective diffusivity are relatively constant for films thicker than ca. 60 nm, we observe measurable suppressions of these properties in films less than ca. 60 nm. These effects occur at length scales that are relevant to transport (ion and water) in the polyelectrolyte binders found in the catalyst layer of the membrane\textendash electrode assembly (MEA) of a functional fuel cell. The thin film methodology and findings presented here provide a platform to quantify and validate models of interfacial impedance used within the fuel cell community and have the potential to lead to improvements in MEA materials, design, and optimization.},

This can be solved asymptotically, giving the probability of the nth link of the polymer passing through the point r to be (L)exp[-27\{r-(5/3)3/5(v/3{$\pi$}l)1/5L3/5\}2(1/20Ll)] where L = nl is the length along the polymer and (L) the normalization.

  abstract = {Polymerization of ionic liquids results in the formation of ionic polymers, which are called poly(ionic liquid)s or polymerized ionic liquids (PIL). This is a brand new form of ionicity in polymer chains with a broad range of applications, though ionic polymers have a long history with the sub-families of polyelectrolytes and ionomers. Although mobility of ions in ionic liquids has named them as the promising candidates for various applications, their applicability is limited in many practical systems because of not having the advantages of neither liquids nor solids, suffering from both leakage issue and high viscosity. PILs perfectly fit with the practical requirements while having almost all features of ionic liquids. This review summarizes some potential applications of PILs. The architecture of PILs can be easily re-designed by both the polymer backbone and outer ion. Not only by post-polymerization but also by in situ ion-exchange, the chemical and mechanical properties of PILs can be tuned. Owing to the high chemical activity and flexible architecture, PILs are the promising candidates for sensors and actuators, electroactive binders, solid and gel electrolytes, non-blocking matrix of nanocomposites, etc.},

The system generates art by looking at art and learning about style; and becomes creative by increasing the arousal potential of the generated art by deviating from the learned styles. We build over Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which have shown the ability to learn to generate novel images simulating a given distribution. We argue that such networks are limited in their ability to generate creative products in their original design. We propose modifications to its objective to make it capable of generating creative art by maximizing deviation from established styles and minimizing deviation from art distribution. We conducted experiments to compare the response of human subjects to the generated art with their response to art created by artists. The results show that human subjects could not distinguish art generated by the proposed system from art generated by contemporary artists and shown in top art fairs. Human subjects even rated the generated images higher on various scales.},

The backbone PILs were synthesized via a facile step growth route, and pendant PILs were synthesized via RAFT. Both PILs were designed to have nearly identical charge density, and the conductivity was found to be substantially enhanced in the backbone PIL systems even after accounting for differences in the glass transition temperature (Tg). Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) revealed an invariance in the location of the amorphous halo between the two systems, while the anion\textendash anion correlation peak was shifted to lower scattering wavevector (q) in the backbone PILs. This indicates an increase in the correlation length of ions and is consistent with charge transport along a more correlated pathway following the polymer backbone. Due to the linear nature of the backbone PILs, crystallization was observed and correlated with changes in conductivity. Upon crystallization, the conductivity dropped, and eventually, two populations of mobile ions were observed and attributed to ions in the amorphous and near-crystallite regions. The present work demonstrates the important role of ion placement on local structure and conductivity as well as the ability of backbone PILs to be used as controllable optical or dielectric materials based on crystallization or processing history.},

In particular, the electric-field-induced shift of the slippage plane from the solid-liquid interface to the interior of the film and the nonmonotonic variation of the friction force are common features of ionic lubricants under strong confinement. We also demonstrate that the molecular structure of the ions plays an important role in determining the electrostriction and electroswelling of the confined film, hence showing the importance of ion-specific effects in electrotunable friction.},

  abstract = {It is known that 12-hydroxystearic acid coupled via ion-pairing with a counterion, such as ethanolamine, self-assembles into supramolecular multilayer tubes that exhibit a peculiar temperature-tunable diameter variation. At a given temperature threshold (T\O{$\uparrow$}), there is a large increase of the tube diameter by almost a factor of 10. We investigate here the nature of the counterion on the self-assembly of such tubes and the variation of their diameter with the temperature. Eight different counterions are used to produce tubes via ion-pairing with 12-hydroxystearic acid. We systematically measure structural parameters at different scales coupling phase contrast microscopy and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), in combination with thermodynamic studies using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The temperature T\O{$\uparrow$} is found to depend sensitively on the nature of the counterion. One could not identify any DSC peak associated with the diameter variation. However, a detailed line-shape analysis of the SANS spectra reveals that a significant softening of the elastic properties of the multilayer tube walls occurs at T\O{$\uparrow$}, for all counterions investigated. Depending on both the temperature and the nature of the counterion, the interlayer spacing in the multilayered structure (respectively, the bilayer thickness) varies in a range from 240 to 440 \AA{} (respectively, from 22 to 42 \AA ), but those variations appear not to be related to T\O{$\uparrow$}. Altogether, our results show that the variation of the diameter is correlated to the nature of the counterion and to the elastic properties of the bilayer stack.},

Each filament is a string of single hemoglobin molecules linked end to end at intervals of 62 A in dry and 64 A in wet fibers. Molecules in neighboring filaments are in longitudinal register so that they form flat hexagonal rings; these rings are stacked so that successive ones are rotated about the fiber axis by 7.3\textdegree. The whole structure repeats after about eight rings. In this structure each molecule makes contact with four neighbors. The likely orientation of the molecules and points of contact between them are discussed. Similar filaments are also observed in normal deoxygenated erythrocytes, but in much lower concentration and aggregated into fibers of irregular diameter. No filaments appear in oxygenated sickle, or normal, adult cells, nor in oxygenated or deoxygenated fetal cells.},

The calculated structure factors, distribution functions, and density profiles were able to provide molecular and mechanistic insights into the properties of these long chain ionic liquids under different conditions, in particular those that lead to the formation of multi-layered ionic liquid films in confinement. Other properties inaccessible to experiment such as in-plane structures and relaxation rates within the films have also been analysed.

Divided by a Lifshitz line, bulk polyelectrolyte solution undergoes either micro- or macro-phase separation. Confinement effects for both scenarios are studied. Composition fluctuations inducing phase separation are classified in terms of eigenmodes of the inverse structure factor operator in the corresponding geometric spaces. Tracking each eigenmode, the instability lines under confinement effects are derived in closed forms. For the confined microphase separation, we find a decaying oscillatory dependence of the spinodal point on the confinement size, which represents the commensurability between the finite period of the soft mode and the confining boundary size. For the confined macrophase separation, a typical mean-field finite size scaling of the Ising universality class is observed under the strong screening condition.},

On metallic platinum surfaces, our hydrodynamic measurements evidence an interfacial soft solid layer extending up to 20 nm away from the top of the layer. The elastic modulus of this interfacial layer, derived from elasto-hydrodynamic measurements, is similar to the one found on Pyrex surfaces.

In this work, we study ionic liquids, single-component liquids composed solely of ions, in an attempt to provide a novel perspective on electrostatic screening in very high concentration (nonideal) electrolytes. We use temperature-dependent surface force measurements to demonstrate that the long-range, exponentially decaying diffuse double-layer forces observed across ionic liquids exhibit a pronounced temperature dependence: Increasing the temperature decreases the measured exponential (Debye) decay length, implying an increase in the thermally driven effective free-ion concentration in the bulk ionic liquids. We use our quantitative results to propose a general model of long-range electrostatic screening in ionic liquids, where thermally activated charge fluctuations, either free ions or correlated domains (quasiparticles), take on the role of ions in traditional dilute electrolyte solutions. This picture represents a crucial step toward resolving several inconsistencies surrounding electrostatic screening and charge transport in ionic liquids that have impeded progress within the interdisciplinary ionic liquids community. More broadly, our work provides a previously unidentified way of envisioning highly concentrated electrolytes, with implications for diverse areas of inquiry, ranging from designing electrochemical devices to rationalizing electrostatic interactions in biological systems.},

  abstract = {Sodium-ion batteries are seeing a surge in interest as a potential complementary energy storage technology in light of skyrocketing demand for lithium-ion batteries. One of the frontiers of improving sodium-ion battery competitiveness is replacing liquid electrolytes with polymer electrolytes, which contain no free-flowing solvent, to increase safety and reduce cost. Their development may one day make viable sodium-metal batteries, which would have considerable advantages in energy density. This review provides an overview of the current field of both solid-polymer and gel-polymer electrolytes for sodium-ion batteries, with a focus in the key performance parameters used to assess them. In particular, their targeted manipulation and significance for practical use are discussed. A major theme is also the interdependence of many electrochemical and mechanical properties. In addition, a quantitative comparison of hitherto reported values for these parameters across various polymer classes is undertaken for the first time.},

Defects can also be induced via device construction, for example, through the alignment coating. This chapter describes some of the defects formed naturally, some that are formed paramorphotically from another mesophase on cooling, and some induced by surface coatings.},

A dedicated electrochemical cell was designed and developed for this purpose with low X-ray absorption, with the possibility to access all azimuthal angles (360\textdegree ) and to remotely control the temperature of the electrolyte. Three well-known fabrication techniques of nanoporous alumina, i.e., single, double, and pretextured, were investigated. The differences in the evolution of the scattering images are described and explained. From these measurements, we could determine at which moment the pores start growing even for very short anodization times. Furthermore, we could follow the thickness of the alumina layer as a function of the anodization time by monitoring the period of the Kiessig fringes. This work is aimed at helping to understand the different steps taking place during the anodization of aluminum at the very early stages of nanoporous alumina formation.},

Based upon the screening principle of Edwards and de Gennes, it appears that chain dimensions should approach their unperturbed values for many systems at polymer volume fractions in the range of 0.05\textendash 0.20, independent of molecular weight. From these results we propose a method for correlating viscoelastic properties in the semi-dilute region which takes into account the contraction of dimensions with concentration. We also suggest the use of a concentration-molecular weight diagram to distinguish the several regions of viscoelastic behaviour.},

Their production via self-ordered porous alumina hard templates serving as shape-defining molds is well-established. However, their release requires the destruction of the hard templates, the fabrication of which is costly and time-consuming, by wet-chemical etching steps with acids or bases. We report the nondestructive mechanical extraction of arrays of cross-linked polyacrylate nanofibers from thus recyclable self-ordered nanoporous alumina hard templates. Silica replicas of the latter were synthesized using the extricated nanofiber arrays as secondary molds that could be mechanically detached from the molded material. The approach reported here, which can be combined with microstructuring, may pave the way for the high-throughput production of both functional nanofiber arrays and ordered nanoporous membranes consisting of a broad range of material systems.},

Gr\^ace \`a la technique de v\'elocim\'etrie par photoblanchiment, nous avons mesur\'e la longueur de glissement de PDMS pour plusieurs temp\'eratures et v\'erifi\'e l'hypoth\`ese de Navier, qui permet de d\'efinir le coefficient de frottement interfacial k comme le rapport entre la viscosit\'e et la longueur de glissement. Loin de la temp\'erature de transition vitreuse, k augmente exponentiellement avec 1/T, tendance que nous avons v\'erifi\'ee par une mesure ind\'ependante pour des lentilles de PDMS r\'eticul\'e. Ainsi, le m\'ecanisme de frottement d'un fondu de polym\`ere est un processus thermiquement activ\'e. La comparaison des \'energies d'activation du frottement et de la viscosit\'e pr\'edit le sens de variation de la longueur de glissement avec la temp\'erature.Le second volet de notre travail s'est focalis\'e sur l'identification des m\'ecanismes mol\'eculaires du frottement de solutions semi-dilu\'ees de polym\`ere. Les exp\'eriences de glissement pour des solutions de PS dans le DEP nous ont permis de mettre en \'evidence un r\'egime transitoire de glissement des solutions, correspondant \`a une mise en glissement du fluide. Nous avons propos\'e un mod\`ele de glissement d'un fluide de Maxwell en accord quantitatif avec les exp\'eriences.Dans le r\'egime de glissement stationnaire, nous avons \'etudi\'e l'influence de la fraction volumique {$\varphi$} en polym\`ere sur le frottement des solutions. En r\'egime newtonien, la loi d'\'echelle mesur\'ee pour k {$\varphi$} en fonction de la fraction volumique met en \'evidence la d\'ependance du coefficient de frottement interfacial avec l'\'ecart \`a la temp\'erature de transition vitreuse des solutions. Nous attribuons le frottement des solutions de PS dans le DEP au frottement des blobs sur la paroi et non \`a la formation d'une couche d\'epl\'et\'ee en polym\`ere.Enfin des exp\'eriences de r\'eflectivit\'e de neutrons nous ont permis d'observer directement l'interface solide / solution de polym\`ere. Nous avons mis en \'evidence l'existence d'une couche adsorb\'ee en polym\`ere. Nous avons mesur\'e son profil de concentration en fonction de la distance \`a la paroi. L'interdigitation des cha\^ines libres et de surface affecte le glissement des solutions.},

  abstract = {Colloidal dispersions of Ni nanorods were synthesized by pulsed electrodeposition of Ni into nanoporous aluminum oxide layers followed by dissolution of the templates. Geometrical characterization of the nanorods by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy allowed us to determine the average length (100\textendash 250 nm) and diameter (20\textendash 40 nm) of the rods and to estimate the thickness of the polyvinylpyrrolidone surfactant layer. Due to their acicular shape, nanorods of the given size are uniaxial ferromagnetic single domain particles and exhibit a distinct anisotropic polarizability. These two characteristic properties are the physical basis for magnetic field-dependent optical transmission and allow us to investigate the rotational diffusion of the nanorods in liquid dispersion. In the present study, we employed AC magnetization measurements, dynamical light scattering and optical transmission measurements in a rotating magnetic field to determine the rotational diffusion coefficient. The results from all three methods were consistent and agree with theory within a factor of 2.},

This evidence is provided by optical reflectivity measurements from planar silica substrates in contact with aqueous solutions of sodium poly(styrene sulfonate). Analysis of the observed reflectivity signal, which features unusual negative signals and optical matching points, with a two-slab model demonstrates the existence of such a polyelectrolyte-free depletion layer. Moreover, the applied model permits the extraction of the corresponding layer thickness, which typically is several tenths of nanometers. This thickness decreases as the inverse square root of the polyelectrolyte concentration, but the actual values exceed the expected Debye length substantially. These results clearly provide independent evidence for the existence of a polyelectrolyte-free depletion layer, as previously suggested on the basis of direct force measurements with the atomic force measurement.},

  abstract = {We perform a comprehensive set of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of ionomer melts with varying polymer architectures and compare the results to experiments in order to understand ionic aggregation on a molecular level. The model ionomers contain periodically or randomly spaced charged beads, placed either within or pendant to the polymer backbone, with the counterions treated explicitly. The ionic aggregate structure was determined as a function of the spacing of charged beads and also depends on whether the charged beads are in the polymer backbone or pendant to the backbone. The low wavevector ionomer peak in the counterion scattering is observed for all systems, and it is sharpest for ionomers with periodically spaced pendant charged beads with a large spacing between charged beads. Changing to a random or a shorter spacing moves the peak to lower wavevector. We present new experimental X-ray scattering data on Na+-neutralized poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) ionomers that show the same two trends in the ionomer peak, for similarly structured ionomers. The order within and between aggregates, and how this relates to various models used to fit the ionomer peak, is quantified and discussed.},

Because polymer brushes have great potential to be used in such applications, there is a need to determine their structure and efficiency in reduced spaces. Using neutron reflectivity, we have directly quantified the density distribution of opposing polymer brushes under confinement in good solvent conditions under confinement. Our measurements show that the density profile in the overlap region between opposing polymer brushes flattens, consistent with predictions from molecular-dynamics simulations. In addition, a significant increase in the density at the anchoring surfaces due to the collapse of the brush layers was observed. This collapse of the brushes in restricted geometries suggests that high-density brushes do not interpenetrate significantly under good solvent conditions. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

While these features may also be observed with other techniques, such as electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy, SAXS provides a means to resolve statistically significant nanometer features in situ, because of its ability to probe over a relatively large sample volume ({$\approx$}1 mm \texttimes{} 1 mm \texttimes{} 1 mm for typical ionic liquids). This makes SAXS well suited to study the structures of ionic liquids (IL). However, a typical SAXS experiment and subsequent analysis require careful considerations of the sample and limits of the analytical approach used. In this chapter, we will present a brief introduction to SAXS with special emphasis on the experimental setup and analysis. At the end of this chapter, X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy will be presented as a potentially powerful technique to resolve the dynamics of scattering phases in IL solutions.},

First, calculations of single macromolecule structure factors are reviewed for many chain architectures and monomer block configurations such as linear, ring, star branched, comb grafted chains and regular ``starburst'' dendrimers either in the homopolymer or copolymer forms. Then, the different methods used to model ``concentration'' effects in polymer solutions (dilute, semidilute, concentrated), polymer melts and blend mixtures are summarized on the basis of the random phase approximation. Polymer chain stiffness is also included in the formalism so that mixtures of liquid crystals and flexible polymers in the single-phase region can be described. Specific examples are included along with various SANS data that were analyzed within this framework. This overview is meant to be a guide to help build up models in order to understand SANS data from many homogeneous polymer systems. It is not meant to be complete and is not an exhaustive review of the literature in the field. Most of the results discussed have been previously published and are brought together here in a unified self-contained approach.},

This is given for the spectrometer without any additional optics, and with the insertion of converging lenses or prisms. The addition of the lenses decreases the sample-aperture contribution to the resolution to enable an increase of neutron current at the sample. They also reduce the size of the penumbra of the beam at the detector, thereby lowering the minimum value of the scattering vector. The prisms correct the effect of gravity on the vertical beam position, and make the beam spot less asymmetric.},

As the barrier layer is etched away, subtle differences revealed through AFM phase imaging in the alumina composition in the barrier layer give rise to a unique pattern of hexagonal walls surrounding each of the barrier layer domes. These nanostructures observed in both topography and phase images can be understood as differences in the oxalate anion contaminated alumina versus pure alumina. This information bears significant implication for catalysis, template synthesis, and chemical sensing applications. From the pore opening etching studies, the etching rate of the barrier layer (1.3 nm/min) is higher than that of the inner cell wall (0.93 nm/min), both of which are higher than the etching rate of pure alumina layer (0.5-0.17 nm/min). The established etching rates together with the etching temperature allow one to control the pore diameter systematically from 10 to 95 nm.},

However, there has been little conclusive experimental evidence for the existence of intermediate mesoscopic structure between the first/second shell correlations shown by neutron scattering on short chain length based materials and the mesophase structure of the long chain length ionic liquid crystals. Herein, small angle neutron scattering measurements have been performed on selectively H/D-isotopically substituted 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ionic liquids with butyl, hexyl, and octyl substituents. The data show the unambiguous existence of a diffraction peak in the low-QQ{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00003.gif"{$><$}mi{$>$}Q{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} region for all three liquids which moves to longer distances (lower QQ{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00004.gif"{$><$}mi{$>$}Q{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}), sharpens, and increases in intensity with increasing length of the alkyl substituent.

This strongly suggests that the peak arises from the second coordination shells of the ions along the vector of alkyl-chain substituents as a consequence of increasing the anisotropy of the cation, and that there is little or no long-range correlated nanostructure in these ionic liquids.},

  title = {{Measurement and analysis of the protective effects of anti-sickling hemoglobins in sickle cell disease: application to gene therapy strategies}},
  author = {Hebert, Nicolas},
  abstract = {Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorders in which red blood cells (RBCs) have a variant of the hemoglobin (Hb), named HbS. It is caused by the substitution of a single amino acid in the -globin subunit: a valine instead of a glutamate in the sixth position. This mutation results in the capability of HbS to polymerize under deoxygenation, leading to the formation of long fibers. Normal RBCs are elastic, flow freely through circulation and typically live between 90-120 days. Sickle RBCs are rigid, dehydrated, highly sensitive to hemolysis, have a 10-20 days lifespan, and tend to get stuck because of HbS polymerization, resulting in blood flow blockage. Advances in cellular and molecular biology have led to the development of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, the only available curative option for patients. However, HSC transplantation faces issues such as relative lack of sibling donors, risks of graft versus host disease or graft rejection. Therefore, gene therapy is a promising alternative. It consists in genetical modification of autologous HSC to express anti-sickling Hb such as fetal Hb (HbF) or HbF-based engineered Hb inhibiting HbS polymerization. To be successful, anti-sickling Hb must be expressed in enough quantity per RBC. Therefore, disposing of tools able to assess both Hb content in RBCs and functional properties of RBCs are mandatory. Herein we describe the development of a new method allowing precise HbF quantification in individual RBCs. We show that this assay is precise enough to measure thresholds of HbF with clinical relevance. As a proof of concept, we determined protective thresholds of HbF in SCD patients treated with hydroxyurea, a wellknown HbF inducer. We also showed that this method is of interest in assessing gene therapy efficacy. Lastly, we report that analyzing RBCs properties can demonstrate functional correction induced by anti-sickling Hb expression. Altogether, we demonstrate the potential and the relevance of these analyzes to better characterize gene therapy strategies efficacy aiming to cure SCD.},

This straightforward method provides access to slip length at top and bottom interfaces in the 1 {$\mu$}m to 1 mm range and to the actual shear rate experienced by the fluid. Based on simple optical imaging and image analysis techniques, this method affords an improvement compared to previously reported methods in which the photobleached fluorescence intensity profiles before and after shear were compared and measured by scanning a photomultiplier. The present method relies on a direct determination of the displacement profile inside the polymer fluid from an analysis of the 3D evolution of the whole photobleached pattern. We demonstrate the potential of this method with measurements of the slip length for an entangled polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) melt, as a function of the shear rate, in contact with several weakly adsorbing surfaces, i.e., end-tethered PDMS or polystyrene (PS) chains, a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of trimethoxy(octadecyl)silane (OTS), and a glassy PS thin film.},

  abstract = {.We present an investigation of the effect of the interaction between a thin polystyrene film and its supporting substrate on its glass transition temperature (TgTg T\_\{\textbackslash rm g\}). We modulate this interaction by depositing the film on end-tethered polystyrene grafted layers of controlled molecular parameters. By comparing TgTgT\_\{\textbackslash rm g\} measurements versus film thickness for films deposited on different grafted layers and films deposited directly on a silicon substrate, we can conclude that there is no important effect of the film-subtrate interaction. Our interpretation of these results is that local orientation and dynamic effects substantial enough to influence TgTgT\_\{\textbackslash rm g\} cannot readily be obtained by grafting prepolymerized chains to a surface, due to intrinsic limitation of the surface grafting density.Graphical abstract Open image in new window},

  abstract = {The temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic boundary condition between a PDMS melt and two different non-attractive surfaces made of either an OTS (octadecyltrichlorosilane) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) or a grafted layer of short PDMS chains has been characterized. A slip length proportional to the fluid viscosity is observed on both surfaces. The slip temperature dependence is deeply influenced by the surfaces. The viscous stress exerted by the polymer liquid on the surface is observed to follow exactly the same temperature dependences as the friction stress of a cross-linked elastomer sliding on the same surfaces. Far above the glass transition temperature, these observations are rationalized in the framework of a molecular model based on activation energies: increase or decrease of the slip length with increasing temperatures can be observed depending on how the activation energy of the bulk viscosity compares to that of the interfacial Navier's friction coefficient.},

It is shown that ammonium-based polyILs exhibit higher dc ionic conductivity at their respective glass transition temperatures (Tg) compared to imidazolium systems. In addition, the length of the alkyl spacer has a more drastic impact on ionic conductivity at comparable time scales of segmental dynamics for ammonium than imidazolium polyILs. Agreement between the characteristic ion diffusion lengths estimated from the dielectric data and the ion-to-ion correlation lengths from the WAXS and all-atom MD simulations is observed. A recently proposed approach is employed to determine ionic mobility in a broad frequency range spanning 5 orders of magnitude below the Tg of polyILs studied, providing access to a regime of diffusivities that is inaccessible to many current experimental techniques. The ion mobility is found to be more sensitive to variation of the molecular structure than to the effective number density of the mobile ions. These results showcase the subtle interplay between molecular structure, morphology, and ion dynamics in polymerized ionic liquids.},

The approach involves using an electrode configuration with lithographically patterned silica nanostructures, which allow for an air gap between the confined ion conductor and one of the electrodes. We observe that the characteristic rate of ion dynamics significantly slows down with decreasing film thicknesses above the calorimetric glass transition of the bulk polymer. However, the mean rates remain bulk-like at lower temperatures. These results highlight the increasing influence of the polymer/substrate interactions with decreasing film thickness on ion dynamics.},

The sequential reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of these monomers via the R-approach using bi-, tri- and tetrafunctional chain transfer agents (CTAs) bearing hydrophobic dodecyl moieties proceeded in a well-controlled manner up to almost quantitative conversion. Polymers with molar masses up to 150~kDa, narrow molar mass distribution (PDI~{$\leq~$}1.3) and high end group functionality were obtained, which are thermoresponsive in aqueous solution showing a LCST (lower critical solution temperature) transition. The temperature-dependent associative behavior of the polymers was examined using turbidimetry, static and dynamic light scattering (SLS, DLS), and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) for structural analysis. At 25~\textdegree C, the polymers form weak transient networks, and rather small hydrophobic domains are already present for polymer concentrations of 5~wt\%. However, when heating above the LCST transition (35\textendash 40~\textdegree C) of the PDEA blocks, the enhanced formation of hydrophobic domains is observed by means of light and neutron scattering. These domains have a size of about 12\textendash 15~nm and must be effectively physically cross-linked as they induce high viscosity for the more concentrated samples. SANS shows that these domains are ordered as evidenced by the appearance of a correlation peak. The copolymer architecture affects in particular the extent of ordering as the four-arm star block copolymer shows much more repulsive interactions compared to the analogous copolymers with a lower number of arms.},

Different templates have been fabricated by the conventional two-step anodization procedure in oxalic acid. Their porosities were modified by chemical wet etching allowing the tuning of their effective refractive indexes (air-filled nanopores + anodic aluminium oxide). By standard spectroscopic light transmission measurements, the effective refractive index for each different template was extracted in the VIS\textendash NIR region. The determination of the intrinsic anodic aluminium oxide refractive index was performed by using the Maxwell\textendash Garnett homogenization theory. The results are coincident for all the fabricated samples. The obtained refractive index ( 1.55) is quite lower ( 22\%) than the commonly used Al2O3 handbook value ( 1.75), showing that the amorphous nature of the anodic oxide structure strongly conditions its optical properties. This difference is critical for the correct design and modeling of optical plasmonic metamaterials based on anodic aluminium oxide nanoporous templates.},

Combination of small angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS, SANS) reveals the structure of the polyelectrolyte network as well as the organisation of the clay additives. The clay-free hydrogel network features a characteristic mesh-size between 20 to 30 nm, depending on the polyelectrolyte concentration. Clay nanoplatelets inside the hydrogel organise in a regular face-to-face stacking manner, with a large repeat distance, following rather closely the hydrogel mesh-size. The presence of the nanoplatelets does not modify the hydrogel mesh size. Further, the clay-compensating counterions (Na+, Ca2+ or La3+) and the clay type (montmorillonite, beidellite) both have a significant influence on nanoplatelet organisation. The degree of nanoplatelet ordering in the hydrogel is very sensitive to the negative charge location on the clay platelet (different for each clay type). Increased nanoplatelet ordering leads to an improvement of the elastic properties of the hydrogel. On the contrary, the presence of dense clay aggregates (tactoids), induced by multi-valent clay counterions, destroys the hydrogel network as seen by the reduction of the elastic modulus of the hydrogel.},

  abstract = {We investigate the organisation of clay nanoplatelets within a hydrogel based on modified ionenes, cationic polyelectrolytes forming physically crosslinked hydrogels induced by hydrogen bonding and {$\pi$}-{$\pi$} stacking. Combination of small angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS, SANS) reveals the structure of the polyelectrolyte network as well as the organisation of the clay additives. The clay-free hydrogel network features a characteristic mesh-size between 20 and 30~nm, depending on the polyelectrolyte concentration. Clay nanoplatelets inside the hydrogel organise in a regular face-to-face stacking manner, with a large repeat distance, following rather closely the hydrogel mesh-size. The presence of the nanoplatelets does not modify the hydrogel mesh size. Further, the clay-compensating counterions (Na+, Ca2+ or La3+) and the clay type (montmorillonite, beidellite) both have a significant influence on nanoplatelet organisation. The degree of nanoplatelet ordering in the hydrogel is very sensitive to the negative charge location on the clay platelet (different for each clay type). Increased nanoplatelet ordering leads to an improvement of the elastic properties of the hydrogel. On the contrary, the presence of dense clay aggregates (tactoids), induced by multi-valent clay counterions, destroys the hydrogel network as seen by the reduction of the elastic modulus of the hydrogel.},

  abstract = {Imaging the enhanced permeation and retention effect by ultrasound is hindered by the large size of commercial ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs). To obtain nanosized UCAs, triblock copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol)-polylactide-poly(1H,1H,2H,2H-heptadecafluorodecyl methacrylate) (PEG-PLA-PFMA) with distinct numbers of perfluorinated pendant chains (5, 10, or 20) are synthesized by a combination of ring-opening polymerization and atom transfer radical polymerization. Nanocapsules (NCs) containing perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) intended as UCAs are obtained with a 2-fold increase in PFOB encapsulation efficiency in fluorinated NCs as compared with plain PEG-PLA NCs thanks to fluorous interactions. NC morphology is strongly influenced by the number of perfluorinated chains and the amount of polymer used for formulation, leading to peculiar capsules with several PFOB cores at high PEG-PLA-PFMA20 amount and single-cored NCs with a thinner shell at low fluorinated polymer amount, as confirmed by small-angle neutron scattering. Finally, fluorinated NCs yield higher in vitro ultrasound signal compared with PEG-PLA NCs, and no in vitro cytotoxicity is induced by fluorinated polymers and their degradation products. Our results highlight the benefit of adding comb-like fluorinated blocks in PEG-PLA polymers to modify the nanostructure and enhance the echogenicity of nanocapsules intended as UCAs.},

The coated channel can regulate solvent permeability when, in response to stimuli, the grafted polymer brush undergoes conformational changes. The effects of the grafting density and the chain length on the flow control capability by the smart channel have been studied. Results show that a nearly 100-fold reduction in permeation rate can be achieved with such smart channels through a proper choice of grafting parameters. Recommendations of suitable grafting parameters for optimum solvent control are given. The interplay between polymer brushes and hydrodynamic flow of the solvent is also briefly revisited. In good solvent regime, the height of the brush with low grafting density decreases with the increase of the pressure drop, but the height of the brush with high grafting density is less perturbed by the pressure drop. In the poor solvent regime, the brush height is even less perturbed by the pressure drop, regardless of the grafting density.},

  abstract = {X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and neutron reflectivity (NR), as well as ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS), are used to examine the in-plane and surface-normal structure of anodic films formed on aluminium alloy AA2024 and pure aluminium. Aluminium and alloy films up to 3500\hspace{0.25em}\AA{} thick were deposited on Si wafers by electron beam evaporation of ingots. Porous anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) films are formed by polarizing at constant voltage up to 20\hspace{0.25em}V noble to the open circuit potential. The voltage sweet spot (5\hspace{0.25em}V) appropriate for constant-voltage anodization of such thin films was determined for both alloy and pure Al. In addition, a new concurrent voltage- and current-control protocol was developed to prepare films with larger pores (voltages higher than 5\hspace{0.25em}V), but formed at a controlled current so that pore growth is slow enough to avoid stripping the aluminium substrate layer. USAXS shows that the pore size and interpore spacing are fixed in the first 10\hspace{0.25em}s after initiation of anodization. Pores then grow linearly in time, at constant radius and interpore spacing. Using a combination of XRR and NR, the film density and degree of hydration of the films were determined from the ratio of scattering length densities. Assuming a chemical formula Al2O3{$\cdot$}xH2O, it was found that x varies from 0.29 for the native oxide to 1.29 for AAO grown at 20\hspace{0.25em}V under concurrent voltage and current control. The average AAO film density of the porous film at the air surface is 2.45\hspace{0.25em}(20)\hspace{0.25em}g\hspace{0.25em}cm-3. The density of the `barrier' layer at the metal interface is 2.9\hspace{0.25em}(4)\hspace{0.25em}g\hspace{0.25em}cm-3, which indicates that this layer is also quite porous.},

In addition, a systematic increase in alkyl side chain length results in about one decade decrease in Tg-independent ionic conductivity correlating with an increase in the characteristic backbone-to-backbone distances found from scattering and simulations. The quantitative comparison between ion sizes, morphology, and ionic conductivity underscores the need for polymerized ionic liquids with small counterions and short alkyl side chain length in order to obtain polymer electrolytes with higher ionic conductivity.},

  abstract = {In any neutron scattering experiment the measurement of the position of the scattered neutrons and their respective velocities is necessary. In order to do so, a position sensitive detector as well as a way to determine the velocities is needed. Measuring the velocities can either be done by using only a single wavelength and therefore velocity or by creating pulses, where the start and end time of each pulse is known and registering the time of arrival at the detector, which is the case we want to consider here. This pulse shaping process in neutron scattering instruments is usually done by using a configuration of several choppers. This set of choppers is then used to define both the beginning and the end of the pulse. Additionally there is of course also a selection in phase space determining the final resolution that can be achieved by the instrument. Taking into account the special requirements of a specific instrument, here a small-angle neutron scattering instrument, creates an additional set of restrictions that have to be taken into account. In this manuscript a chopper configuration for two possible settings, namely a maximum flux and a high-resolution mode will be presented.},

SANS instruments allow investigations of the structure of materials in the size regime between Angstroms up to micrometers. As very versatile instruments, they usually cater to the scientific needs of communities, such as chemists, biologists, and physicists, ranging from material and food sciences to archeology. They can offer analysis of the micro- and mesoscopic structure of the samples, as well as an analysis of the spin states in the samples, for example, for magnetic samples. SKADI, as a broad range instrument, thus offers features, such as an extremely flexible space for the sample environment, to accommodate a wide range of experiments, high-flux, and optimized detector-collimation system to allow for an excellent resolution of the sample structure, short measurement times to be able to record the internal kinetics during a transition in the sample, as well as polarized neutron scattering. In this manuscript, we describe the final design for the construction of SKADI. All of the features and capabilities presented here are projected to be included into the final instrument when going into operation phase.},

In our separation system, the external flow and electric field are applied to particles, such that particle movement is affected by pressure-driven flow, electroosmosis, and electrophoresis. We then analyzed the hydrodynamic drag force and electrophoretic force applied to the particles in opposite directions. Based on this analysis, micro- and nano-sized particles were separated according to their electrophoretic mobilities with high separation efficiency. Because the separation can be achieved in a simple T-shaped microchannel, without the use of internal electrodes, it offers the advantages of low-cost, simple device fabrication and bubble-free operation, compared with conventional {$\mu$}-FFE methods. Therefore, we expect the proposed separation method to have a wide range of filtering/separation applications in biochemical analysis.},

The local structure has been investigated by applying indirect Fourier transformation and square-root deconvolution techniques. We demonstrate that the micelles maintain their locally cylindrical structure in this temperature regime despite the significant change in the spontaneous curvature of the surfactant. Detailed information on the micellar flexibility has been obtained from the SANS data by applying a nonlinear least-squares fitting procedure based upon a numerical expression for the single-chain scattering function of a worm-like chain with excluded volume effects. Particular attention has been given to the determination of quantitative numbers for the ``intrinsic'' persistence length as well as for the contribution from electrostatic interactions upon the addition of a small fraction of an ionic surfactant. The results have been compared with predictions from theoretical models for polyelectrolytes.},

Theories that predict the properties of molten polymers in confined geometries (as in a thin film) generally start from the premise that the chains maintain their unperturbed gaussian conformation in the direction parallel to the surface. This assumption has been questioned, however, by recent experiments. Here we use small-angle neutron scattering to characterize the chain structure and conformation in ultrathin (less than 100 nm) polymer films. The conformation can be deduced directly from the scattering from mixtures of protonated and perdeuterated polystyrenes. We find that the gaussian conformation is retained parallel to the surfaces in all cases. Chain sizes equal the bulk value, within experimental uncertainty, although there is a systematic trend towards chain swelling in the thinnest films.},

  abstract = {The necessary coordination of the motions of different parts of a polymer molecule is made the basis of a theory of the linear viscoelastic properties of dilute solutions of coiling polymers. This is accomplished by use of the concept of the submolecule, a portion of polymer chain long enough for the separation of its ends to approximate a Gaussian probability distribution. The configuration of a submolecule is specified in terms of the vector which corresponds to its end-to-end separation. The configuration of a molecule which contains N submolecules is described by the corresponding set of N vectors. The action of a velocity gradient disturbs the distribution of configurations of the polymer molecules away from its equilibrium form, storing free energy in the system. The coordinated thermal motions of the segments cause the configurations to drift toward their equilibrium distribution. The coordination is taken into account by the mathematical requirement that motions of the atom which joins two submolecules change the configurations of both submolecules. By means of an orthogonal transformation of coordinates, the coordination of all the motions of the parts of a molecule is resolved into a series of modes. Each mode has a characteristic relaxation time. The theory produces equations by means of which the relaxation times, the components of the complex viscosity, and the components of the complex rigidity can be calculated from the steady flowviscosities of the solution and the solvent, the molecular weight and concentration of the polymer, and the absolute temperature. Limitations of the theory may arise from the exclusion from consideration of (1) very rapid relaxation processes involving segments shorter than the submolecule and (2) the obstruction of the motion of a segment by other segments with which it happens to be in contact. Another possible cause of disagreement between the theory and experimental data is the polydispersity of any actual polymer; this factor is important because the calculated relaxation times increase rapidly with increasing molecular weight.},

First-principles-based simulation methods are used here to understand the structure, stability, energetics, and microscopic adsorption mechanism of various hydrophilic and hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs; 1-butyl 3-methylimidazolium [BMIm]+[X]-, where X = Cl, DCA, HCOO, BF4, PF6, CH3SO3, OTF, and TFSA) interacting with a metallic surface. We have selected the Au(111) surface as a potential electrode model, and our computations show that ILs (anions and cations) adsorb specifically at some selective adsorption sites. Indeed, hydrophilic anions of ILs are strongly adsorbed on the gold surface (via Au-Cl and Au-N bonds at Au(111)), whereas hydrophobic anions are weakly bonded. The [BMIm]+ is always found to be stabilized parallel to the metal surface, irrespective of the nature of the anion, through various kinds of noncovalent interactions. Mulliken, L\"owdin, and Hirshfeld charge analyses reveal that there is significant charge transfer between ILs and the surface that may enhance the charge transfer mechanism between the surface and electrolytes for electrochemical applications. Our study shows that the electrostatic and van der Waals interactions are in action at these interfaces. Moreover, we show that there are several covalent and noncovalent interactions between ILs and the metal surface. These interactions play an essential role to maintain the electrostatic behaviors at the solid-liquid interface. The present findings can be helpful to predict specific selectivity and subsequent design of materials for energy harvesting and catalysis applications.},

Time evolution of the bilayer interface at various temperatures was examined by dynamic secondary ion mass spectroscopy in conjunction with neutron reflectivity. When the bilayer was annealed at a temperature above bulk glass transition temperature, Tgb, the interfacial thickening was well expressed by the context of Fickian diffusion. On the other hand, in the case of an annealing temperature above surface glass transition temperature, Tgs, and below Tgb, the interface monotonically thickened with the time at first and then turned to be independent. This means that chains went across the ``mobile'' interface and then reached the ``dead'' bulk region in which the diffusivity should be frozen. Hence, it was claimed that chains could diffuse discernibly in the surface region even at a temperature lower than the Tgb. On the basis of temperature and molecular weight dependences of quasi-equilibrium interfacial thickness after a sufficiently long time, a possible model of mobility gradient in the surface region was proposed.},

The AFM force profiles of the neutral PVP?PS brush are less steep than the corresponding surface forces data in the regime of high brush compression, in agreement with a recent molecular simulation study that indicated the tip would splay polymer chains and penetrate the brush. We also observe a bimodal distribution of interaction distances for the AFM force profiles of the PVP?PS brush which we ascribe to the tip sampling regions of higher and lower chain density during consecutive force measurements. AFM F?D profiles of the PtBS?NaPSS brush show a strong dependence of interaction distance on NaCl concentration, and a plot of interaction distance vs salt concentration shows predicted power law behavior. Images of both the PVP?PS and PtBS?NaPSS brushes show that the chain density is not uniform which gives rise to variations in the interaction distances measured by AFM. By facilitating measurements of local force profiles, AFM complements SFA measurements of interfacial forces and allows measurement of brush heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {THE use of lubricants to reduce friction and wear between rubbing surfaces has been documented since antiquity1\textendash 3. Recent approaches have focused on boundary lubrication by surfactant-like species coating the surfaces, whereby the friction between them is replaced by the weaker forces required for shear of adhesive contacts between the surfactant layers3,4. An alternative approach is to tether polymer chains to the surfaces by one end which, when swollen by a solvent, then act as molecular `brushes' that may facilitate sliding. The normal forces between sliding brush-bearing surfaces have been previously investigated5,6, but the lateral forces, which are the most important from the point of view of lubrication, are harder to measure. Here we report the measurement of lateral forces in such a system. We find a striking reduction in the effective friction coefficients {$\mu$}b between the surfaces to below our detection limit ({$\mu$}b {$<$} 0.001), for contact pressures of around 1 MPa and sliding velocities from zero to 450 nm s-1. We believe that this effect is due to the long-ranged repulsion, of entropic origin, between the brushes, which acts to keep the surfaces apart while maintaining a relatively fluid layer at the interface between them.},

  abstract = {Shear responsive friction at solid-liquid interfaces could become an important component in various technologies such as microfluidics, lubrication and polymer processing. Our model system is a polymer brush grafted on a solid substrate, subject to shear flow by an entangled polymer solution. The structure of the brush was probed both experimentally by Rheo - Neutron Reflectometry, and by computer simulations based on soft blobs. In the simulations we demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to suppress polymer chain crossings and observe entanglement dynamics using only the soft blob repulsive potential. To confine the blobs between two hard plates we introduce a new boundary condition, mirror-and-shift, which enables a monotonic, rather than oscillatory, density profile climb at the interface. The simulation techniques are then combined and compared against experimental measurement of polymer brush thickness as a function of shear rate. A good quantitative agreement is obtained, concluding that the brush thickness collapses perpendicularly to the applied shear flow, and is thus a non-linear second order effect. We attribute this effect to the normal stress difference, commonly occurring in entangled polymer liquids in their shear thinning flow regime.},

Surface functionalization using polymer brushes is one route to such properties, particularly in the case of entangled polymers. We report on neutron reflectometry measurements of polymer brushes in entangled polymer solutions performed under controlled shear as well as coarse-grained computer simulations corresponding to these interfaces. Here we show a reversible and reproducible collapse of the brushes, increasing with the shear rate. Using two brushes of greatly different chain lengths and grafting densities, we demonstrate that the dynamics responsible for the structural change of the brush are governed by the free chains in solution rather than the brush itself, within the range of parameters examined. The phenomenon of the brush collapse could find applications in the tailoring of nanosensors and as a way to dynamically control surface friction and adhesion.},

The height of the brushes in good solvent is found to vary systematically with the PS molecular weight, Mw, consistent with a power law of the form Mw3/5. Dramatic changes in the flow rate are observed as a function of solvent quality, which is tuned by varying the ratio of good to poor solvent (toluene to cyclohexane, respectively) in the solvent mixture. Flow control is achieved via the regulating effect triggered by the spontaneous and reversible response of the brush height to the quality of the solvent flowing through the membrane nanopores.},

However, fundamental understanding of interconnection between ionic transport and mechanical properties in PolyILs is far from complete. In this work, local charge transport and structural changes in films of a PolyIL are studied using an integrated experiment-theory based approach. Experimental data for the kinetics of charging and steady state current\textendash voltage relations can be explained by taking into account the dissociation of ions under an applied electric field (known as the Wien effect). Onsager's theory of the Wien effect coupled with the Poisson\textendash Nernst\textendash Planck formalism for the charge transport is found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The agreement between the theory and experiments allows us to predict structural properties of the PolyIL films. We have observed significant softening of the PolyIL films beyond certain threshold voltages and formation of holes under a scanning probe microscopy (SPM) tip, through which an electric field was applied.

  abstract = {To achieve large spontaneous polarization for ferroelectric liquid crystalline polymers, we have designed a series of mesogen-free isotactic polyethers with sulfonylated side chains. Different from prior studies using linear alkyl side chains, in this work a methyl branch was implemented in the alkyl side chains of the chiral polyethers. As a result of the continuous twist from the methyl branches and strong dipole-dipole interactions among neighboring sulfonyl groups, a helical chain conformation with tilted side chains was achieved. When the branched side chains were short (e.g., C5) and double chirality existed in both the main chain and side chains, a crystalline structure was obtained. When the branched side chains were long (e.g., {$\geq$} C8) and single chirality existed in the main chain, an ordered hexagonal columnar liquid crystalline phase was induced. Their high-field dielectric property was studied by electric displacement-electric field (D-E) loop tests; however, no ferroelectric behavior was observed up to 200 MV/m. It was considered that the dipole-dipole interaction among neighboring sulfonyl groups in the helical chains was too strong to allow easy ferroelectric flipping.},

Using proton pulsed-gradient NMR, we here study the equilibrium micrometer-scale self-diffusion of poly(butadiene) chains along {$\sim$}100 {$\mu$}m long, 20 and 60 nm wide channels in alumina, which is a system without confinement-related changes in segmental relaxation time. Unlike previous reports on nonequilibrium start-up diffusion normal to an interface or into particulate nanocomposites, we find a reduction of the diffusivity that appears to depend only upon the pore diameter but not on the molecular weight in a range between 2 and 24 kg/mol. We rationalize this by a simple volume-average model for the monomeric friction coefficient, which suggests a 10-fold surface-enhanced friction on the scale of a single molecular layer. Further support is provided by applying our model to the analysis of published data on large-scale diffusion in thin films.},

  abstract = {Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition of polyelectrolytes within nanopores in terms of the pore size and the ionic strength was experimentally studied. Anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes, which have aligned, cylindrical, nonintersecting pores, were used as a model nanoporous system. Furthermore, the AAO membranes were also employed as planar optical waveguides to enable in situ monitoring of the LbL process within the nanopores by optical waveguide spectroscopy (OWS). Structurally well-defined N,N-disubstituted hydrazine phosphorus-containing dendrimers of the fourth generation, with peripherally charged groups and diameters of approximately 7 nm, were used as the model polyelectrolytes. The pore diameter of the AAO was varied between 30؊116 nm and the ionic strength was varied over 3 orders of magnitude. The dependence of the deposited layer thickness on ionic strength within the nanopores is found to be significantly stronger than LbL deposition on a planar surface. Furthermore, deposition within the nanopores can become inhibited even if the pore diameter is much larger than the diameter of the G4-polyelectrolyte, or if the screening length is insignificant relative to the dendrimer diameter at high ionic strengths. Our results will aid in the template preparation of polyelectrolyte multilayer nanotubes, and our experimental approach may be useful for investigating theories regarding the partitioning of nano-objects within nanopores where electrostatic interactions are dominant. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced ionic strength dependence of polyelectrolyte transport within the nanopores can be used to selectively deposit a LbL multilayer atop a nanoporous substrate.},

The tethered polymer layer is a stable Langmuir film of a diblock copolymer spread on the air\textemdash liquid interface of a selective solvent. Due to the restricted conformational freedom of the grafted chain, a depletion layer at the grafting surface is expected. In our system, this depletion zone is enhanced and thus observable experimentally due to a repulsion between the polymer and the surface. The structure of the tethered layer is adequately described by a parabolic profile followed by an exponential tail, with a depletion layer at the surface. In the presence of mobile chains in solution, the grafted polymer layer is compressed: the thickness decreases and the monomer volume fraction increases. This compression may result from a re-equilibration of the osmotic pressure of the polymer layer, or from a screening of the monomer excluded volume interaction due to penetration of the mobile chains into the grafted layer. In this paper, we present our experimental data on the effects of mobile polymer concentration and chain length on the structure of the tethered chain. From these data, we construct a phase diagram to identify the regions of interpenetration of the mobile chains into the grafted layer.},

The approach is based on pulse anodization of aluminum employing a series of potential waves that consist of two or more different pulses with designated periods and amplitudes, and provides unique tailoring capability of the internal pore structure of anodic alumina. Pores of the resulting AAOs exhibit a high degree of directional coherency along the pore axes without branching, and thus are suitable for fabricating novel nanowires or nanotubes, whose diameter modulation patterns are predefined by the internal pore geometry of AAO. It is found from microscopic analysis on pulse anodized AAOs that the effective electric field strength at the pore base is a key controlling parameter, governing not only the size of pores, but also the detailed geometry of the barrier oxide layer.},

  abstract = {Specular X-ray reflectivity (SXR) can be used, in the limit of the effective medium approximation (EMA), as a high-resolution shape metrology for periodic patterns on a smooth substrate. The EMA means that the density of the solid patterns and the spaces separating the periodic patterns are averaged together. In this limit the density profile as a function of pattern height obtained by SXR can be used to extract quantitative pattern profile information. Here we explore the limitations of SXR as a pattern shape metrology by studying a series of linear grating structures with periodicities ranging from 300 nm to 16 |im and determining at which length scales the EMA breaks down. We also study the angular dependence of the grating orientation with respect to the incident X-ray beam. The gratings systematically are rotated through a series of azimuthal angles with the incident X-ray beams ranging from 0 \textdegree{} to 90 \textdegree. The applicability of the EMA is related to the coherence length of the X-ray source. When the coherence length of beam is larger than the physical dimension of grating periodicities, EMA can be applied for characterizing nanostructures. For our slit-coUimated X-ray source, the coherence length in the direction parallel to the long axis of the slit is on the order of 900 nm while the coherence length along the main axis of the beam appears to be in the range of (22 to 26) |im.},

The chapter presents the dynamics of linear chains that could be described by simple reptation arguments, assuming that each chain essentially sees a frozen environment during its reptation time, as soon as the number of entanglements per chain is larger than 10. Below this value, the dynamics is strongly accelerated mainly through the constraint release mechanism: a simple reptation behavior is recovered when the matrix is frozen down, indicating that the fluctuations of the chains inside their tube are not dominant in this acceleration of the motion.},

Theoreticians have realized that grafted macromolecules are nice statistical objects wriggling around under thermal motion, which give rise to nontrivial long-range entropic effects. These can be described by elegant scaling laws and analogies with quantum or classical mechanics. For experimenters the area turned out to be a marvelous playground in which both very simple and sophisticated techniques such as x-ray or neutron scattering and reflectivity, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Rutherford backscattering, and optical and atomic force microscopy (AFM) have been used to discover interesting and subtle phenomena. All this effort was also motivated by the importance of grafted layers in applications such as paints, adhesives, lubricants, colloidal stabilizers, and composite materials. By anchoring a thin, soft polymer layer to a solid surface, one can tune the surface properties. In this short article, we will discuss how the wetting and spreading of liquids and polymer melts can be profoundly altered by the presence of such protective layers.},

Silanization bases on the adsorption, self-assembly and covalent binding of silane molecules onto surfaces and results in a densely packed, SAM. Following wet chemical routines, the quality of the monolayer is often variable and, therefore, unsatisfactory. The process of self-assembly is not only affected by the chemicals involved and their purity but is also extremely sensitive to ambient parameters such as humidity or temperature and to contaminants. Here, a reliable and efficient wet-chemical recipe is presented for the preparation of ultra-smooth, highly ordered alkyl-terminated silane SAMs on Si wafers.

  abstract = {We analyze the mean-field theory of polymer brushes inside cylindrical channels to predict the properties of the collapse transitions of the brush, related with an opening of the channel, upon changes of the solvent quality. The interplay of compressibility of the polymer brush under poor solvent conditions and the surface tension due to opening of a central void in the channel lead to a discontinuous phase transition, which is characterized by a bi-stable free energy landscape. Our model can be extended to describe copolymer brushes with modified end-groups. The different solubility properties of the two monomer species can be used to tune the thermal response of the brush-decorated pore. Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to quantitatively test the mean-field approach. In particular, it is demonstrated that, within a certain parameter range, copolymer brushes exhibit a lower critical transition temperature, that is, lead to an opening of the pore by increasing the temperature. The simulations quantitatively confirm essential predictions of the mean-field model such as the impact of the degree of polymerization, the radius of the nanopore, and size or interactions of the end-groups.}

The experimental data are iteratively fitted to reconstruct an estimate of the true underlying reciprocal-space scattering., Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) is a powerful technique for measuring the nanostructure of coatings and thin films. However, GISAXS data are plagued by distortions that complicate data analysis. The detector image is a warped representation of reciprocal space because of refraction, and overlapping scattering patterns appear because of reflection. A method is presented to unwarp GISAXS data, recovering an estimate of the true undistorted scattering pattern. The method consists of first generating a guess for the structure of the reciprocal-space scattering by solving for a mutually consistent prediction from the transmission and reflection sub-components. This initial guess is then iteratively refined by fitting experimental GISAXS images at multiple incident angles, using the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) to convert between reciprocal space and detector space. This method converges to a high-quality reconstruction for the undistorted scattering, as validated by comparing with grazing-transmission scattering data. This new method for unwarping GISAXS images will broaden the applicability of grazing-incidence techniques, allowing experimenters to inspect undistorted visualizations of their data and allowing a broader range of analysis methods to be applied to GI data.},

  abstract = {During the anisotropic growth from globular to wormlike micelles, the basic interactions among distinct parts of the surfactant monomer, its counterion, and additives are fundamental to tune molecular self-assembly. We investigate the addition of sodium salicylate (NaSal) to hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride and bromide (CTAC and CTAB), 1-hexadecylpyridinium chloride and bromide (CPyCl and CPyBr), and benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium chloride (BDMC), which have the same hydrophobic tail. Their potential to enhance viscoelasticity by anisotropic micellar growth upon salt addition was compared in terms of (i) the influence of the headgroup structure, and (ii) the influence of surfactant counterion type. Employing proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), we focused on the molecular conformation of surfactant monomers in the core and polar shell regions of the micelles and their interactions with increasing concentration of NaSal. The viscoelastic response was investigated by rotational and oscillatory rheology. We show that micellar growth rates can be tuned by varying the flexibility and size of the surfactant headgroup as well as the dissociation degree of the surfactant counterion, which directly influences the strength of headgroup\textendash counterion pairing. As a consequence, the morphological transitions depend directly on charge neutralization by electrostatic screening. For example, the amount of salt necessary to start the rodlike-to-wormlike micelle growth depends directly on the number of dissociated counterions in the polar shell.},

  abstract = {A combination of nanosized dielectric relaxation (BDS) and thermal spectroscopy (SHS) was utilized to characterize the dynamics of thin films of poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) (thicknesses: 7\textendash 160 nm). For the BDS measurements, a recently designed nanostructured electrode system is employed. A thin film is spin-coated on an ultraflat highly conductive silicon wafer serving as the bottom electrode. As top electrode, a highly conductive wafer with nonconducting nanostructured SiO2 nanospacers with heights of 35 or 70 nm is assembled on the bottom electrode. This procedure results in thin supported films with a free polymer/air interface. The BDS measurements show two relaxation processes, which are analyzed unambiguously for thicknesses smaller than 50 nm. The relaxation rates of both processes have different temperature dependencies. One process coincides in its position and temperature dependence with the glassy dynamics of bulk PVME and is ascribed to the dynamic glass transition of a bulk-like layer in the middle of the film. The relaxation rates were found to be thickness independent as confirmed by SHS. Unexpectedly, the relaxation rates of the second process obey an Arrhenius-like temperature dependence. This process was not observed by SHS and was related to the constrained fluctuations in a layer, which is irreversibly adsorbed at the substrate with a heterogeneous structure. Its molecular fluctuations undergo a confinement effect resulting in the localization of the segmental dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the molecular dynamics of an adsorbed layer in thin films.},

Dilational and shear complex elasticity moduli covering a frequency range from 10-3 to 0.2 Hz have been discussed. It was found that the air/water interface behaves as a poor solvent for PMMA monolayers, thus suggesting that the polymer coils take collapsed soft-disks (pancakes) shape at the interface. The equilibrium and dynamic results suggest a fluid-to-soft-glass transition as the polymer concentration increases above a critical packing fraction at constant temperature. This two-dimensional transition is in agreement with results previously discussed for the dilational rheology of poly(4-hydroxystyrene) [F. Monroy, F. Ortega, R. G. Rubio, H. Ritacco, and D. Langevin, J. Chem. Phys. 95, 056103 (2005)]. Furthermore, the {$\Gamma$}-dependence of the relaxation dynamics of the monolayers suggests that the gel state may be considered as a fragile soft glass.},

The Rouse model applies well for molecular weights lower than the average molecular weight between entanglements, providing that one takes into account the proper variations of the radius of gyration. Moreover, local motions at the scale of Kuhn segments have to be considered in order to describe correctly the relaxation modes intermediate between the terminal zone and the glassy plateau.On the other hand, reptation models are commonly used for describing the entangled regime. We propose an expression of the shear modulus which accounts not only for the terminal modes (reptation, tube length fluctuations and tube renewal), but also for the relaxation modes responsible for the plateau zone and the transition of the glassy plateau. A crossover region between the unentangled and untangled regimes is located around . When the molecular weight increases, a shift transfer of Rouse modes towards reptation modes occurs. That leads to a continuity of the expression of the shear modulus over the entire range of molecular weights.},

In all cases, before the precipitation of the material, the micelles shape changes from spherical to rod-like, where the structure of the rod-like micelles is linked to the structure of the 2D-hexagonal precipitated material. In addition, the kinetics of hydrolysis of the inorganic precursor (TEOS) has been determined by in situ Raman spectroscopy. More specifically, by comparing synthesis made with different acids (HNO3, HBr, HCl, H2SO4, and H3PO4), it is found that materials prepared using the ``salting-out'' anions (SO42- and H2PO4\textendash ) are much better ordered than with the ``salting-in'' anions (NO3\textendash{} and Br\textendash ).},

  abstract = {Polymerized ionic liquids (PILs) are a special class of polyelectrolytes with ionic liquid (IL) species being covalently attached to the repeating unit. The rheological properties of PIL in IL solutions are strongly influenced by the electrostatic screening between IL and PIL chains. However, the effect of IL electrostatic screening on the rheology of PIL in IL solutions remains elusive. To address this challenging yet important question, we conduct detailed rheological characterization of a model system containing a PIL [PC4-TFSI: poly(1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide)] in a mixture of a salt-free solvent (DMF: dimethylformamide) and an IL [Bmim-TFSI: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] solution, with low to high IL concentrations, while spanning dilute and semidilute polymer regimes. We compare the specific viscosity {$\eta$}sp and the longest relaxation time {$\lambda$} of PILs measured at various Bmim-TFSI concentrations from 0 M (pure DMF) to 3.42 M (pure Bmim-TFSI) with the scaling predictions for ordinary polyelectrolyte solutions. We find good agreement at low IL concentrations but significant deviations at higher IL concentrations. We capture this discrepancy by proposing and validating a modified scaling law accounting for the modified screening length in concentrated solutions of ordinary salts. We propose that extended PIL chains initially shrink due to the charge screening effect at low IL concentrations but revert to expanded configuration at higher IL concentrations due to the charge underscreening effect when the screening length increases with increasing IL concentrations. Our results shed new insights on the conformation of PIL in IL solutions and, for the first time, provide a valid reference for the study of general polyelectrolyte solutions at high salt concentrations, where the Debye\textendash H\"uckel theory is no longer valid.},

  abstract = {Ionic-liquid-based polyelectrolytes, or polymerized ionic liquids (PILs), are a special class of polyelectrolytes having advantageous properties of ionic liquids. Previous studies have found that the electrostatic interaction and therefore the number of dissociated counterions govern the conformation and dynamics of PIL chains in solutions. Herein, we investigate the effect of the solvent dielectric constant {$\epsilon$}r on the effective charge fraction feff for a model PIL, poly(1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) (PC4-TFSI), by measuring the shear viscosity of the PC4-TFSI in a series of non-ionic good solvents with dielectric constants ranging from 7.9 for tetrahydrofuran to 178 for N-methylformamide. For a given molar concentration cp of PC4-TFSI monomers, the specific viscosity {$\eta$}sp decreases monotonically with decreasing {$\epsilon$}r. In the semidilute unentangled regime, the dependence of {$\eta$}sp on cp in solvents at high {$\epsilon$}r follows the scaling law of {$\eta$}sp ({$\propto$} cp0.5) for salt-free polyelectrolytes in good solvents, but its scaling relationship gradually shifts toward the scaling law of {$\eta$}sp ({$\propto$} cp1.3) for charge neutral polymers in good solvents as {$\epsilon$}r is decreased. Moreover, the cp dependence of {$\eta$}sp in solvents having different {$\epsilon$}r falls onto a single curve by adding an ionic liquid as salt ions to screen the charges on PC4-TFSI chains. These results indicate that the effective charge fraction on PC4-TFSI chains decreases with decreasing {$\epsilon$}r, in good agreement with the predicted trend by the Manning counterion condensation model. As a result, we demonstrate that the counterion condensation takes place in PIL solutions, indicating an ability to control the properties of PIL solutions simply by changing the solvent dielectric constant. Because PILs have recently attracted significant attention with a wide range of applications for batteries, molecular separations, and antimicrobial, our results can provide useful information about the rheological properties of PIL solutions, optimizing processing operations for PILs and thus PIL-based material design with improved system performance.},

The impact of quaternization on the physicochemical properties of the copolymers, and notably the solvation properties, was further studied. The structure of the synthesized polymers and the quaternization degrees were determined by infrared and nuclear magnetic spectroscopies, while their thermal characteristics were studied by differential scanning calorimetry and their thermal stability and degradation by thermogravimetric analysis (TG-DTA). Attention was given to their optical properties, where UV-Vis and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were carried out. The optical band gap of the polymers was calculated and correlated with the degree of quaternization. The study was further orientated towards the solvation properties of the polymers in binary solvent mixtures that strongly depend on the degree of quaternization, enabling a better understanding of the key polymer (solute)-solvent interactions. The assessment of the underlying solvation phenomena was performed in a system of different ratios of DMSO/H2O and the solvatochromic indicator used was Reichardt's dye. Solvent polarity parameters have a significant effect on the visible spectra of the nitrogen quaternization of PVP studied in this work and a detailed path towards this assessment is presented.},

Characteristically, the velocity dependence of friction between apparent solid/solid contacts can strongly deviate from the classically assumed velocity independence. Here, we show that a nondestructive friction between solid tips with radius on the scale of hundreds of nanometers and solid hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers has a strong velocity dependence. Specifically, using laterally oscillating quartz tuning forks, we observe a linear scaling in the velocity at the lowest accessed velocities, typically hundreds of micrometers per second, crossing over into a logarithmic velocity dependence. This crossover is consistent with a general multicontact friction model that includes thermally activated breaking of the contacts at subnanometric elongation. We find as well a strong dependence of the friction on the dimensions of the frictional probe.},

Use of these membranes is currently limited largely due to their size and overall fragility. The objective of this research was to improve mechanical properties of AAO membranes through use of high temperature heat treatment to induce phase transformations in the material. A repeatable two-step anodization process was developed for consistent sample fabrication and heat treatments were performed at 900 \textdegree C and 1200 \textdegree C in air. The pore morphology and phase composition of the as-anodized and heat-treated membranes were then observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Microhardness testing was utilized to evaluate the mechanical behavior of the membranes before and after heat treatment. As-anodized AAO membranes were determined to be amorphous, and membranes heat-treated to 900 \textdegree C and 1200 \textdegree C were transformed to crystalline phases while retaining their original porous structure. Heat treatment to 900 \textdegree C resulted in formation of the {$\gamma$}-alumina transition phase in the skeleton regions of the membrane and nanocrystalline regions of {$\alpha$}-alumina throughout the structure, while heat treatment to 1200 \textdegree C completely transformed the material to the stable {$\alpha$}-alumina structure. The microhardness testing showed an increase in hardness from 2.5 {$\pm$} 0.4 GPa to 4.7 {$\pm$} 1.0 GPa in the transformation from amorphous to {$\alpha$}-alumina.},

Previous work describing capillary trapping in porous media has primarily focused on pore-space geometry, wettability, and fluid viscosity contrast, while acknowledging, but not quantifying, the potential impact of surface roughness. We introduce a method to implement surface roughness with controlled variation of hillock density and heights into glass microfluidic chips and investigate surface roughness impacts on gas trapping following imbibition of water into air. We demonstrate that surface roughness with hillock height-to-pore-depth ratios (herein called {$\Omega$}) less than a media-dependent threshold ({$\Omega$} = 6\%\textendash 10\% in the micromodels) does not promote nonwetting phase (gas) trapping. By contrast, rougher micromodels with {$\Omega$} values larger than the aforementioned roughness threshold show a dramatic increase in the saturation of trapped gas (gas saturation values up to 64\%) due to an observed change in imbibition dynamics from binary filling to pendular-ring formation within pore throats as well as capillary pinning within pore bodies. Furthermore, when the micromodel intermediate capillary number results are compared to Land's model, only the roughest microfluidics chips ({$\Omega$} {$>$} 10\%) fall within the literature-described values of the characteristic trapping constant, C, implying that surface roughness is also a key gas trapping control, independent of or in addition to pore-space geometry and wettability. An a priori menisci stability criterion and a heuristic explanation based on local contact angle variations are proposed to explain surface roughness-induced trapping.},

Moreover, several recent studies, in which Hb toxicity were investigated, have shown conflicting outcomes. Uncertainties over the potential role of these species may in part be due to the protein preparation method of choice, the use of published extinction coefficients and the lack of suitable controls for Hb oxidation and heme loss. Highly purified and well characterized redox forms of human Hb were used in this study and the extinction coefficients of each Hb species (ferrous/oxy, ferric/met and ferryl) were determined. A new set of equations were established to improve accuracy in determining the transient ferryl Hb species. Additionally, heme concentrations in solutions and in human plasma were determined using a novel reversed phase HPLC method in conjugation with our photometric measurements. The use of more accurate redox-specific extinction coefficients and method calculations will be an invaluable tool for both in~vitro and in~vivo experiments aimed at determining the role of Hb-mediated vascular pathology in hemolytic anemias and when Hb is used as oxygen therapeutics.},

Herein, the chemical structure, preparation method and application examples of the colloidal PIL systems are summarized along with an intensive discussion of their advantages and limitations in some specific cases. Micelles formed from PIL homopolymer and copolymer in selective conditions are given a detailed description. At the end, the employment of PIL polymers to stabilize carbon materials to form a colloid dispersion of carbon nanostructures has been particularly emphasized.},

Less studied are brushes grown from concave geometries of high curvature, such as mesopores, despite their application potential in the separation sciences. The method used here, surface-initiated, activators-regenerated-by-electron-transfer, atom-transfer radical polymerization (SIARGET-ATRP), is used to grow a polystyrene brush grown from aluminum oxide pores of 5 nm diameter, to-date the most confined geometry in which ATRP has been conducted. The brush is characterized by TGA, AFM, and FTIR, the latter two methods applied specifically to the external brush. Additionally, permporometry as well as permeability and retention measurements are used to characterize the graft within the mesopores. We show that the brush length is tunable, that the brush length is solvent-dependent, and we also demonstrate the application potential of this hybrid material as an organic solvent nanofiltration membrane. This new class of membranes shows excellent performance: a toluene permeability of 2.0 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 accompanied by a 90\% rejection of diphenylanthracene (MW 330 g mol-1).},

By contrast, the smaller-anion compound,  [BMIM] + [ BF 4 ] - [BMIM]+[BF4]- , shows only a single layer of enhanced electron density at the interface. The different layering behaviors, and their characteristic length scales, correspond well to the different bulk diffraction patterns, also measured in this study. Complementary measurements of the surface and interface energies showed no significant different between the two RTILs. The combined bulk-interface results support the conclusion that the interfacial ordering is dominated by the same electrostatic ion-ion interactions dominating the bulk correlations, with hydrogen bonding and dispersion interactions playing only a minor role.}

In this high-energy x-ray reflectivity study, the temperature-dependent structures of three ionic liquids with the tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate anion in contact with a charged sapphire substrate were investigated with submolecular resolution. All three RTILs show strong interfacial layering, starting with a cation layer at the substrate and decaying exponentially into the bulk liquid. The observed decay length and layering period point to an interfacial ordering mechanism, akin to the charge inversion effect, which is suggested to originate from strong correlations between the unscreened ions. The observed layering is expected to be a generic feature of RTILs at charged interfaces. Reflections of high-energy x-rays reveal that when in contact with a sapphire surface, and likely other surfaces, an ionic liquid forms alternating layers of cations and anions.

The equal flight-path condition is also valid for experiments measuring sharp (Bragg-like) peaks, or where the intensity is required at specific scattering vectors, as in low-angle diffraction of ordered or semiordered systems.

This results from a correlation in angle and position for points at the sample producing an extra (cross-correlation) term in the resolution function. Expressions for this general case are derived. They are similar to those when the incident beam is defined at the sample position, except that both the source and the sample contributions have an extra term which is proportional to the finite distance between the end of the incident collimation and the sample.},

The correlator works by using two algorithms: for large lag times ({$\tau$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1 {$\mu$}s), a classical time-mode scheme, based on the measure of the number of pulses per time interval, is used; differently, for {$\tau$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 1 {$\mu$}s a photon-mode (PM) scheme is adopted and the correlation function is retrieved from the sequence of the photon arrival times. Single auto- and cross-correlation functions can be processed online in full real time up to count rates of {$\sim$}1.8  MHz and {$\sim$}1.2 MHz, respectively. Two autocorrelation (A-A, B-B) and a cross correlation (A-B) functions can be simultaneously processed in full real time only up to count rates of {$\sim$}750 kHz. At higher count rates, the online processing takes place in a delayed modality, but with no data loss. When tested with simulated correlation data and latex spheres solutions, the overall performances of the correlator appear to be comparable with those of commercial hardware correlators, but with several nontrivial advantages related to its flexibility, low cost, and easy adaptability to future developments of PC and data acquisition technology.},

Viscoelastic spectra at given temperatures for PC2VITFSI with lower molecular weight were able to be well superimposed on each other to make a master curve. PC2VITFSI with a molecular weight larger than 1.4 \texttimes{} 105 were entangled with each other, showing a rubbery region in the master curves. However, viscoelastic spectra for PC2VITFSI with higher molecular weight (larger than 2.2 \texttimes{} 105) were not superimposed in the rubbery and terminal regions due to the presence of two rubbery elastic origins, i.e., chain entanglement and ionic aggregates. The presence of huge ionic aggregates was unable to be confirmed by SAXS measurements, but the formation of ion pairs between a cation and an anion was supported by the WAXS profiles. Master curves of PC2VITFSI exhibited extended shoulders in the glass\textendash rubber transition region; these arose from the relaxation mode due to segmental motions of positively charged polymer chains affected by neighboring TFSI\textendash{} anions. The entanglement and critical molar mass of PC2VITFSI were determined to be 4.5 \texttimes{} 104 and 2.2 \texttimes{} 104, respectively.},

In this review we discuss concepts and features that are relevant to the adsorption of neutral and charged polymers at equilibrium, including the type of polymer/surface interaction, the solvent quality, the characteristics of the surface, and the polymer structure. We pay special attention to the case of charged polymers (polyelectrolytes) that have a special importance due to their water solubility. We present a summary of recent progress in this rapidly evolving field. Because many experimental studies are performed with rather stiff biopolymers, we discuss in detail the case of semi-flexible polymers in addition to flexible ones. We first review the behavior of neutral and charged chains in solution. Then, the adsorption of a single polymer chain is considered. Next, the adsorption and depletion processes in the many-chain case are reviewed. Profiles, changes in the surface tension and polymer surface excess are presented. Mean-field and corrections due to fluctuations and lateral correlations are discussed. The force of interaction between two adsorbed layers, which is important in understanding colloidal stability, is characterized. The behavior of grafted polymers is also reviewed, both for neutral and charged polymer brushes.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, the understanding of the molecular basis of sickle cell disease has progressed rapidly. It is now possible to describe the structure of the gel of polymerized deoxyhemoglobin S at molecular and atomic levels and to begin to understand the mechanism of formation of this gel from hemoglobin solutions. There are several current hypotheses for the pathophysiology of this disease based on molecular as well as cellular studies. Recently, it has become possible to measure the amounts of polymerized hemoglobin within erythrocyte populations and thereby demonstrate the existence of polymer in cells at very high oxygen saturation values. This unexpectedly low solubility of deoxyhemoglobin S in sickle erythrocytes can be largely accounted for by the theory of protein nonideality, with some contribution from cell heterogeneity. These results show that hemoglobin S in the erythrocyte behaves as it does in very concentrated hemoglobin solutions. There are strong indications, for both SS and AS cells, of the existence of cells with significant amounts of polymerized deoxyhemoglobin S but without morphological deformation (sickling). On the basis of these and other results, two models relating these biophysical findings to pathophysiology are discussed. First, it is likely that with deoxygenation there is a continuum of cellular changes. Initially, small amounts of polymer form; only with severe and prolonged deoxygenation do large domains of highly ordered, polymerized hemoglobin form in the erythrocyte and cause it to sickle. Second, we combine this model of cellular changes with information from rheologic studies to suggest an alternate model for the pathophysiology of the disease. We postulate that flexibility, governed by the amount and alignment of intracellular polymer, is the principal determinant of the flow of sickle erythrocytes. While cells that have large amounts of ordered polymer may be caught in the capillaries and venules, some cells at relatively high oxygen saturation, with polymer but no deformation, may have difficulty traversing the constriction of the precapillary arterioles. The implications of these recent molecular and cellular studies, as well as of the several models, for the therapy of sickle cell disease are discussed. In general, our analysis suggests that a therapeutically effective strategy is feasible and that certain approaches seem particularly propitious.},

Their structure and properties can be finely tuned by unlimited combinations issued from extended pools of cationic and anionic building blocks.

Their preparation takes advantage of the beneficial features of the multiple combinations between the Click chemistry philosophy with macromolecular engineering techniques to afford tunable and highly functional ion conducting materials thus stretching out the actual boundaries of PILs macromolecular design.

Within a concise introduction to elastic small-angle scattering, the basics of shape, structure, and interactions of particles are presented, as well as the scattering from polymer chains. The scattering properties of polymer chains can be described within models that can also account for stress-strain properties. In neutron scattering, stretched polymer chains and their fluctuation width can be directly accessed by taking advantage of the difference in the scattering length between H and D atoms. Further, SANS can equally cope with the mounting interest in the characterization of polymers in nowadays popular multiphase materials. Using contrast matching or a combination of two probes, i.e. neutrons and x-rays, the solid phase can be made invisible or visible. This allows to extract new structural information about the rubbery matrix that could not be obtained separately by other methods. Current literature on filler scattering in polymer nanocomposites will be reviewed. The most common fillers where scattering has been shown to be decisive are carbon black, silica, polymeric fillers, and, to a lesser extent, clay. Scattering is a powerful tool to analyse the filler structure in a non destructive way, in the dry (pure filler) state, in solution, or inside macroscopically thick nanocomposite samples. The scattered intensity is obtained as an average over the complete sample, thereby decreasing the impact of possible artefacts as it might be the case in direct-space imaging. In this review part, it is attempted to give an overview of the morphology of the hard component typically encountered in filled polymer systems, its modes of deformation as the sample is deformed, as well as a summary of possible routes of data interpretation and modelling.},

  abstract = {Measurement of the thermoviscoelastic behavior of glass-forming liquids in the nanometer size range offers the possibility of increased understanding of the fundamental nature of the glass-transition phenomenon itself. We present results from use of a previously unknown method for characterizing the rheological response of nanometer-thick polymer films. The method relies on the imaging capabilities of the atomic force microscope and the reduction in size of the classical bubble inflation method of measuring the biaxial creep response of ultrathin polymer films. Creep compliance as a function of time and temperature was measured in the linear viscoelastic regime for films of poly(vinyl acetate) at a thickness of 27.5 nanometers. Although little evidence for a change in the glass temperature is found, the material exhibits previously unobserved stiffening in the rubbery response regime.},

The proton conductivity of Nafion thin films was examined as a function of the thickness along both directions, normal and parallel to the interface. Neutron reflectivity measurements revealed that a water-containing multilamellar structure was formed at the substrate interface. The presence of the interfacial layer, or the two-dimensional proton-conductive pathway, suppressed and enhanced the out-of-plane and in-plane proton conductivities, respectively. The method of proton conductivity in the interfacial region differed from that in the bulk, namely, the Grotthuss mechanism. Using laminated films, we conclude by showing that the proton conductivity in the Nafion thin film changes on the basis of the interface-to-volume ratio. This knowledge will be helpful for the design of devices containing polyelectrolytes with solid materials.},

Low-molecular-weight carbonates of ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate were incorporated into the two-dimensional (2D) nanostructured electrolyte composed of mesogen-containing carbonate and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. The incorporation of low-molecular-weight carbonates increased the ionic conductivity with maintaining 2D nanostructures in the LC state. High-power performances at relatively high current densities induced by higher ionic conductivities have been achieved by LC electrolytes with low-molecular-weight carbonates. Furthermore, room-temperature operation of LIBs using LC electrolytes is reported for the first time. In the research field of electrolytes for LIBs, we demonstrate the progress of a new category of LC electrolytes.},

In the presence of nonrepulsive interfaces, prolonged annealing in the liquid state allows, in fact, recovering bulk segmental mobility. Our measurements prove that, while the fraction of unrelaxed chains increases upon nanoconfinement, the dynamics of equilibration is almost unaffected by the film thickness. We show that the rate of equilibration of nanoconfined chains does not depend on the structural relaxation process but on the feasibility to form an adsorbed layer. We propose that the equilibration of the thin polymer melts is driven by the slow relaxation of interfacial chains upon irreversible adsorption on the confining walls.},

This trend is in contrast to existing treatments of roughness which conclude it is a source of slower dynamics, and to measurements of thin films of poly(2-vinylpiridine), whose dynamics is roughness invariant. Our experimental evidence indicates the faster interfacial dynamics originate from a reduction in interfacial density, due to the noncomplete filling of substrate asperities. Importantly, our results agree with the same scaling that describes the density dependence of bulk materials, correlating segmental mobility to a term exponential in the specific volume, and with empirical relations linking an increase in glass transition temperature to larger interfacial energy.},

Characterization of depletion layer length scale, concentration, and dynamics has remained elusive due in large part to the lack of suitable real-space experimental techniques. The short length scales associated with depletion layers have traditionally prohibited direct imaging. By overcoming this limitation via adaptations of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we directly measure the concentration profile of polymer solutions at a nonadsorbing wall under Poiseuille flow. Using this approach, we 1) confirm the theoretically predicted concentration profile governed by entropically driven depletion, 2) observe depletion layer narrowing at low to intermediate shear rates, and 3) report depletion layer composition that approaches pure solvent at unexpectedly low shear rates.},

However, the progress in practical applications is impeded by the lack of knowledge about the hierarchic organization of both individual bottlebrushes and their assemblies. We delineate fundamental correlations between molecular architecture, mesoscopic conformation, and macroscopic properties of polymer melts. Numerical simulations corroborate theoretical predictions for the effect of grafting density and side-chain length on the dimensions and rigidity of bottlebrushes, which effectively behave as a melt of flexible filaments. These findings provide quantitative guidelines for the design of novel materials that allow architectural tuning of their properties in a broad range without changing chemical composition. Steric repulsion between grafted side chains inhibits interpenetration of bottlebrushes, transforming them into flexible filaments.

It promises to obtain bulk-scale, statistically sound information on the morphological details of the nanostructure, and has thus led to many a researcher investing their time in it over the last eight decades of development. Due to pressure from scientists requesting more details on increasingly complex nanostructures, as well as the ever improving instrumentation leaving less margin for ambiguity, small-angle scattering methodologies have been evolving at a high pace over the past few decades. As the quality of any results can only be as good as the data that go into these methodologies, the improvements in data collection and all imaginable data correction steps are reviewed here. This work is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of all data corrections, to aid the small-angle scatterer to decide which are relevant for their measurement and how these corrections are performed. Clear mathematical descriptions of the corrections are provided where feasible. Furthermore, as no quality data exist without a decent estimate of their precision, the error estimation and propagation through all these steps are provided alongside the corrections. With these data corrections, the collected small-angle scattering pattern can be made of the highest standard, allowing for authoritative nanostructural characterization through its analysis. A brief background of small-angle scattering, the instrumentation developments over the years, and pitfalls that may be encountered upon data interpretation are provided as well.},

  abstract = {Analysis and modeling of small-angle scattering data from systems consisting of colloidal particles or polymers in solution are discussed. The analysis requires application of least-squares methods, and the basic principles of linear and non-linear leastsquares methods are summarized with emphasis on applications in the analysis of small-angle scattering data. These include indirect Fourier transformation, square-root deconvolution, size distribution determinations, and modeling. The inclusion of corrections for instrumental smearing effects is also discussed. The most common analytical expressions for model form factors and structure factors are summarized. An example of analysis of small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering data from block copolymer micelles is given.},

  abstract = {Methods for the free-form determination of size distributions for systems with hard-sphere interactions are described. An approximation, called the local monodisperse approximation, is introduced. Model calculations show that this approximation gives relatively small errors even at relatively high polydispersities and large volume fractions. The size distributions are determined by least-squares methods with smoothness and non-negativity constraints. The local monodisperse approximation leads to normal equations that are linear in the amplitude of the size distribution. This is used when solving the least-squares problem: only the two effective parameters describing the interference effects are treated as nonlinear parameters in an external optimization routine. The parameters describing the size distribution are determined by a linear least-squares method. The size distribution is also determined using the nonlinear equations from the calculation of the scattering intensity in the Percus\textendash Yevick approximation. For this, a nonlinear least-squares routine with a smoothness constraint and a non-negativity constraint is used. Both approaches are tested by analysis of simulated examples calculated by the analytical expressions in the Percus\textendash Yevick approximation. Finally, the methods are applied to two sets of experimental data from silica particles and from {$\delta{'}$} precipitates in an Al\textendash Li alloy. For the simulated examples, good agreement is found with the input distributions. For the experimental examples, the results agree with the expected and known properties of the samples.},

  abstract = {Off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations on semiflexible polymer chains with and without excluded volume interactions have been performed. The model used in the simulations is a discrete representation of the worm-like chain model of Kratky and Porod applied in the pseudocontinuous limit. The ratio between the cross-section radius R of the chain and the statistical segment length b was chosen to be R/b = 0.1 which corresponds to the value found for polymer-like micelles. The ratio R/b is equivalent to a reduced binary cluster integral of B = 0.30, which is in accordance with the value for polystyrene in a good solvent. The scattering functions of the semiflexible chains have been determined with a precision of 1-2\% for L/b = 0.3-640, where L is the contour length of the chain. Numerical approximations to these functions have been determined which interpolate between the simulated functions, and these can be used in the analysis of experimental scattering data. The approximations have been used in least-squares fitting of experimental small-angle neutron scattering data from polystyrene in a good solvent.},

Structurally, the linear free chains do not penetrate the grafted corona but increase the osmotic pressure of the solution, collapsing the grafted polymer and leading to eventual aggregation of the grafted particles at high matrix concentrations. Dynamically, the relaxations of the grafted polymer are controlled by the solvent viscosity according to the Zimm model on short time scales. On longer time scales, the grafted chains are confined by neighboring grafted chains, preventing full relaxation over the experimental time scale. Adding free linear polymer to the solution does not affect the initial Zimm relaxations of the grafted polymer but does increase the confinement of the grafted chains. Our results elucidate the physics underlying the slow relaxations of grafted polymer.},

  abstract = {We construct first the equilibrium concentration profiles for a polymer solution near a solid wall (or near the free surface). The wall is characterized by a certain ``free energy of sticking'', ylt which is negative for adsorption and positive for a repulsive surface. We are concerned with the case where yi (per monomer) is small, but where the energy per chain is large. (1) For the attractive case (with a good solvent), we find a remarkable, self-similar form for the profile which is essentially independent of the bulk concentration. Most monomers are confined in a region of thickness D \textasciitilde{} | |``3/2. But the ``equivalent hydrodynamic thickness'', eH, is controlled by the longest loops and should scale like the coil size in solution, fiF. (2) We also extend these considerations to metastable adsorption. For instance, starting from the above situation, we assume that the polymer in solution is washed out, leaving an adsorption layer; then the solvent is cooled down to a point: the adsorption layer shrinks significantly. In particular, we predict that all large loops disappear. All results now depend on the sample history: if the layer would have been prepared by contact between a solvent and the wall, we would expect eH comparable to the solvent coil size. (3) For the repulsive case, the exponents describing the depletion layer had been constructed earlier through a tentative argument based on the osmotic pressure near the wall. We rederive these exponents here by a more direct scaling method. For all these cases, we construct the scaling form of the interfacial tension and check the associated Gibbs identities.},

  abstract = {Membranes currently used for separation of sub-micron particles in biomedical applications are of asymmetric or anisotropic variety and are made from polymers such as polysulfone or polyacrylonitrile. Several bioincompatibilities are associated with these polymeric membranes limiting their applications. Aluminum oxide substrates have been chosen for several reasons, including compatibility with our processing protocols, chemical and thermal stability, and ease in post-processing surface modification. Several studies have shown this material to be bioinert. However, the biocompatibility of the membrane material must be further investigated and improved. With proper surface modification, the protein adsorption can be lowered and the non-fouling characteristics can be improved. In this study we graft alumina membranes with a biocompatible polymer like poly (ethylene glycol) to investigate protein adsorption. Albumin and fibrinogen were selected as model proteins since they are important components in immunogenic and thrombogenic reactions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize PEG films on alumina membranes.},

A break in the linearized slope of n (and d) was identified as the film glass transition temperature, Tg. For thinner samples only surface plasmon resonances could be analyzed, but the kinetic mode, i.e. reflectivity-versus-temperature scans, still gave reliable Tg values. The PMMA films of different thicknesses, ranging from d {$\sim$} 3 nm to d {$\sim$} 800 nm, were prepared by three different techniques: by spin-casting from solution, by the grafting-from approach and by the Langmuir/Blodgett/Kuhn technique. We found that all these films prepared on hydrophobic substrates show the expected decrease of Tg for ultrathin samples (d {$<$} 100 nm). However, this behavior is independent of the strongly varying intramolecular architecture and organization of the macromolecular chains in the various films.},

The anodic alumina film was generated by the anodization of an aluminum film evaporated on the substrate. The morphology of the barrier layer between the porous film and the substrate was different from that of anodic films grown on aluminum substrates. The removal of the barrier layer and the electrochemical growth of nanowires within the ordered pores were accomplished without the need to remove the anodic film from the substrate. We fabricated porous anodic alumina samples over large areas (up to 70 cm2), and deposited in them nanowire arrays of various materials. Long nanowires were obtained with lengths of at least 9 {$\mu$}m and aspect ratios as high as 300. Due to their mechanical robustness and the built-in contact between the conducting substrate and the nanowires, the structures were useful for electrical transport measurements on the arrays. The method was also demonstrated on patterned and non-planar substrates, further expanding the range of applications of these porous alumina and nanowire assemblies.},

  abstract = {We measured the form factor of bottle-brush macromolecules under good solvent conditions with small-angle neutron scattering and static light scattering. The systems under investigation are brushes, synthesized via the grafting-from route, built from a poly(alkyl methacrylate) backbone to which poly( n n -butyl acrylate) side chains are densely grafted. The aim of our work is to study how the systematic variation of structural parameters such as the side chain length and backbone length change the conformation of the polymer brushes in solution. All spectra can be consistently described by a model, considering the bottle-brush polymers as flexible rods with internal density fluctuations. Parameters discussed are (1) the contour length per main chain monomer  l b lb , (2) the fractal dimension of the side chains  D s Ds , as well as (3) the fractal dimension  D D , and (4) the Kuhn length  {$\lambda$} k {$\lambda$}k  of the overall brush.  l b =0.253{$\pm$}0.008nm lb=0.253{$\pm$}0.008nm  is found to be independent of the side chain length and equal to the value found for the bare main chain, indicating a strongly stretched conformation for the backbone due to the presence of the side chains. The fractal dimension of the side chains is determined to be  D s =1.75{$\pm$}0.07 Ds=1.75{$\pm$}0.07  which is very close to the value of  1/0.588{$\approx$}1.70 1/0.588{$\approx$}1.70  expected for a three-dimensional self-avoiding random walk (3D-SAW) under good solvent conditions. On larger length scales the overall brush appears to be a 3D-SAW itself  (D=1.64{$\pm$}0.08) (D=1.64{$\pm$}0.08)  with a Kuhn-step length of  {$\lambda$} k =70{$\pm$}4nm {$\lambda$}k=70{$\pm$}4nm . The value is independent of the side chain length and 46 times larger than the Kuhn length of the bare backbone  ( {$\lambda$} k =1.8{$\pm$}0.2nm) ({$\lambda$}k=1.8{$\pm$}0.2nm) . The ratio of Kuhn length to brush diameter  {$\lambda$} k /d{$\geqslant$}20 {$\lambda$}k/d{$\geqslant$}20  determines whether lyotropic behavior can be expected or not. Since longer side chains do not lead to more persistent structures,  {$\lambda$} k /d {$\lambda$}k/d  decreases from 8 to 4 with increasing side chain length and lyotropic behavior becomes unlikely.},

However, there exist barriers for many laboratories to acquire two-photon microscopes. Additionally, if owned, typical systems are difficult to modify to rapidly evolving methodologies. A potential solution to these problems is to enable scientists to build their own high-performance and adaptable system by overcoming a resource insufficiency. Here we present a detailed hardware resource and protocol for building an upright, highly modular and adaptable two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscope that can be used for in vitro or in vivo applications. The microscope is comprised of high-end componentry on a skeleton of off-the-shelf compatible opto-mechanical parts. The dedicated design enabled imaging depths close to 1 mm into mouse brain tissue and a signal-to-noise ratio that exceeded all commercial two-photon systems tested. In addition to a detailed parts list, instructions for assembly, testing and troubleshooting, our plan includes complete three dimensional computer models that greatly reduce the knowledge base required for the non-expert user. This open-source resource lowers barriers in order to equip more laboratories with high-performance two-photon imaging and to help progress our understanding of the cellular and physiological function of living systems.},

A potential solution to these problems is to enable scientists to build their own high-performance and adaptable system by overcoming a resource insufficiency. Here we present a detailed hardware resource and protocol for building an upright, highly modular and adaptable two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscope that can be used for in vitro or in vivo applications. The microscope is comprised of high-end componentry on a skeleton of off-the-shelf compatible opto-mechanical parts. The dedicated design enabled imaging depths close to 1 mm into mouse brain tissue and a signal-to-noise ratio that exceeded all commercial two-photon systems tested. In addition to a detailed parts list, instructions for assembly, testing and troubleshooting, our plan includes complete three dimensional computer models that greatly reduce the knowledge base required for the non-expert user. This open-source resource lowers barriers in order to equip more laboratories with high-performance two-photon imaging and to help progress our understanding of the cellular and physiological function of living systems.},

It is now well-established that they adopt a multilayered structure and that the composition of the layers changes with the potential of the electrode. In some cases, potential-driven ordering transitions in the first adsorbed layer have been observed in experiments probing the interface on the molecular scale or by molecular simulations. This perspective gives an overview of the current understanding of such transitions and of their potential impact on the physical and (electro)chemical processes at the interface. In particular, peaks in the differential capacitance, slow dynamics at the interface, and changes in the reactivity have been reported in electrochemical studies. Interfaces between ionic liquids and metallic electrodes are also highly relevant for their friction properties, the voltage-dependence of which opens the way to exciting applications.},

Gradients in local glass transition and related properties near different types of interfaces are compared and contrasted.           ,                             Polymers are increasingly being used in applications with nanostructured morphologies where almost all polymer molecules are within a few tens to hundreds of nanometers from some interface. From nearly three decades of study on polymers in simplified nanoconfined systems such as thin films, we have come to understand property changes in these systems as arising from interfacial effects where local dynamical perturbations are propagated deeper into the material.

For this purpose, we focus on the effect of parameters related to the geometrical constraints (pore diameter), the size of the macromolecules (their molar mass and the ionic strength), and the interaction between the pore walls and the adsorbed chains (modulated by the ionic strength). Our results reveal the existence of two regimes in the mechanism of PEM growth: (i) the first regime is comparable to that observed on flat substrates, including the influence of ionic strength and (ii) the second regime, which is slower in terms of kinetics, results from the interconnection established between polyelectrolyte chains across the pores and leads to the formation of a dense gel. As a consequence, the diffusion of polyelectrolytes in nanopores becomes the controlling factor of PEM growth in this second regime. The dense gel, owing to its peculiar structure, enhances the formation of nanowires or of partially occluded nanotubes in some cases, depending on initial pore dimensions.},

The essential tools of the polymer physical chemist or engineer are derived in this book without skipping any steps. The book is a self-contained treatise that could also serve as a useful reference for scientists and engineers working with polymers. While no prior knowledge of polymers is assumed, the book goes far beyond introductory polymer texts in the scope of what is covered. The fundamental concepts required to fully understand polymer melts, solutions and gels in terms of both static structure and dynamics are explained in detail. Problems at the end of each Chapter provide the reader with the opportunity to apply what has been learned to practice. The book is divided into four parts. After an introduction in Chapter 1, where the necessary concepts from a first course on polymers are summarized, the conformations of single polymer chains are treated in Part 1. Part 2 deals with the thermodynamics of polymer solutions and melts, including the conformations of chains in those states. Part 3 applies the concepts of Part 2 to the formation and properties of polymer networks. Finally, Part 4 explains the essential aspects of how polymers move in both melt and solution states. In all cases, attention is restricted to concepts that are firmly entrenched in the field.},

Basic differences between the two methods are found in the way in which the preferred orientation affects the intensity distribution. The method is applied to the SAXS of SiO2-surfactant nanocomposite films which contain highly oriented arrays of cylinders. It is shown that up to eight structural parameters can be obtained by this method which characterize size, imperfection and preferred orientation of the two-dimensional hexagonal lattice formed by the cylinders, the radius and the polydispersity of the cylinders, and the interface boundary.},

Using small-wide angle x-ray scattering (SWAXS), three major diffraction peaks are found: two high- Q peaks that show little dependence on the alkyl chain length ( n ) and a low- Q peak that strongly depends both in amplitude and position on n . This low- Q peak is the signature of the occurrence of nanoscale structural heterogeneities whose sizes depend on the length of the alkyl chain and are related to chain segregation into nano-domains. Using optical heterodyne-detected Raman-induced Kerr effect spectroscopy, we access intermolecular dynamic features that suggest that chain aggregation only occurs for n {$\geq$}3, in agreement with the SWAXS data. Moreover, the increase in the frequency and width of the main band of the optical Kerr effect spectra in going from n = 2 to 3 is consistent with stiffening of the intermolecular potential due to chain segregation. Multicomponent line shape analysis suggests that there are least three modes that underlie the main band in the 0\textendash 200 cm -1 region of the optical Kerr effect spectra of these ionic liquids. Given the similarity of ionic liquids to other complex fluid systems, we assign the low-frequency component to a fast {$\beta$}-relaxation mode and the intermediate- and high-frequency components to librational modes.},

The finalized polymer is capable of generating an electrical current when contacted by a metal electrode. Using this property, energy harvesting experiments were conducted by cyclically contacting a gold-surface electrode with the charge fixed surface of the polymer. Control experiments verified the effect of immobilizing the cations at the surface. By synthesizing a polymer with the optimal composition ratio of ionic liquid to macromonomer, an output of 77 nW/cm2 was obtained with a load resistance of 1 M{$\Omega$} at 1 Hz.

It was possible to observe the interparticle effect without corrections for resolution and to verify the first minimum and the secondary maximum in accordance with the theoretical scattering curve. The accuracy in determining the radius of gyration has been improved over that determined in previous neutron small angle scattering studies. With respect to hydrogen deuterium exchange it was possible to observe the kinetics of the slow exchanging protons with an accuracy of 30 protons. Finally a new and much more precise method for the determination of particle volumes was developed. With this method the density of the scattering lengths of the solvent was altered by varying its D2O content, and, using a real zero point method, that mixing ratio was determined at which the small angle scattering of the solution vanishes. From the mixing ratio the volume of the nonhydrated hemoglobin was obtained as 84,000 {$\pm$} 2,000 A3.},

Parmi ces mat\'eriaux, le SBA-15, form\'e en milieu super-acide \`a partir de P123 (un copolym\`ere tribloc) comme tensioactif et de TEOS comme pr\'ecurseur inorganique de silice, est un des plus \'etudi\'es.

Sp\'ecifiquement, nos r\'esultats ont montr\'e que l'hydrolyse-condensation du TEOS en solution a permis la formation d'oligom\`eres de silice, qui interagissent avec la couronne des micelles sph\'eriques de P123, pour progressivement former des micelles hybrides cylindriques organiques/inorganiques, qui vont ensuite pr\'ecipiter en une m\'esophase hybride 2D-hexagonale. Ce mod\`ele de synth\`ese est appel\'e \guillemotleft{} transition sph\`eres-cylindres \guillemotright.

En fonction de la temp\'erature, il est donc possible de former des mat\'eriaux hybrides de forme grains de riz, b\^atons (courts ou longs) ou m\^emes sous forme de tores.

The alumina surfaces obtained by anodic oxidation can be detached from the bare metal by using a voltage detachment procedure, without employing chemical etching techniques. This procedure leads to large area porous alumina membranes with closed backsides. Prestructuring of the aluminium base metal leads to ordered pore regions at anodisation voltages of 25, 40 and 50 V, resulting in porous alumina membranes with pore diameters of 33, 40 and 72 nm. The careful opening of the backside alumina membranes can be realised by acid treatment leading to highly flexible large area porous alumina membranes with complete through-hole pore morphology. The backside pore-opening process realised by chemical etching is strongly dependent on time and acid concentration and is best monitored routinely by microscopy techniques in order to gain control over the process.

Both techniques rely on the single-scattering assumption and any deviation may lead to erroneous interpretation of structural and dynamical results. Typical effects of multiple scattering on measured static and dynamic scattering from model colloidal suspensions are presented, and it is demonstrated that the same information content as in a single-scattering experiment can be extracted after applying appropriate corrections. The perturbations induced by multiple scattering on resolution, photon statistics and speckle visibility are evaluated and the required optimal experimental conditions are discussed. In many cases, multiple scattering might be tolerable to a certain extent, especially if any shortcomings are outweighed by beneficial effects from counting statistics, acquisition time and signal-to-background ratio. The presented study may help to optimize future experiments and serve as a guide for data evaluation for this type of system.},

When the molecular weight is higher than the entanglement length, the strong deviations from liquidlike behavior are observed. We find that the long wavelength cutoff vector, ql,c, scales with film thickness, d as d-1.1{$\pm$}0.1 rather than the usual d-2 expected for simple liquids. If we assume that these deviations are due to surface pinning of the polymer chains, then our results are consistent with the formalism developed by Fredrickson et al. to explain the capillary wave spectrum that can propagate in a polymer brush.},

For significantly convex surfaces, increased surface curvature increases the maximum amount of shear swelling. In contrast, brushes grafted onto concave surfaces with the same grafting density show diminished shear swelling as the grafting surface becomes more concave. The shear response of nonplanar brushes is important in a variety of possible applications, including the fabrication of pressure-sensitive microvalves and dynamic membranes and an understanding of the rheological behavior of hairy-rod polymers or molecular bottlebrushes.},

Secondly, the preparation of gel type polymer electrolytes, named ``ion gels'', based on ionic liquids and poly(ionic liquid)s is discussed in terms of preparation methods and composition. Due to the presence of free ions, such ion gels provide higher ionic conductivity (10-2-10-3S/cm at 25\textordmasculine C) than SPEs. Finally, the actual applications of innovative polymer electrolytes based on poly(ionic liquid)s are summarized and their advantages are discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed study of free polymer surfaces and their effects on the measured glass transition temperature (Tg) of thin polystyrene (PS) films. Direct measurements of the near-surface properties of PS films are made by monitoring the embedding of 10 and 20 nm diameter gold spheres into the surface of spin-cast PS films. At a temperature T = 378 K({$>$} Tg), the embedding of the spheres is driven by geometrical considerations arising from the wetting of the gold spheres by the PS. At temperatures below Tg (363 K {$<$} T {$<$} 370 K), both sets of spheres embed 3\textendash 4 nm into the PS films and stop. These studies suggest that a liquid-like surface layer exists in glassy PS films and also provide an estimate for the lower bound of the thickness of this layer of 3\textendash 4 nm. This qualitative idea is supported by a series of calculations based upon a previously developed theoretical model for the indentation of nanoscale spheres into linear viscoelastic materials. Comparing data with simulations shows that this surface layer has properties similar to those of a bulk sample of PS having a temperature of 374 K. Ellipsometric measurements of the Tg are also performed on thin spin-cast PS films with thicknesses in the range 8 nm {$<$} h {$<$} 290 nm. Measurements are performed on thin PS films that have been capped by thermally evaporating 5 nm thick metal (Au and Al) capping layers on top of the polymer. The measured Tg values (as well as polymer metal interface structure) in such samples depend on the metal used as the capping layer, and cast doubt on the general validity of using evaporative deposition to cover the free surface. We also prepared films that were capped by a new non-evaporative procedure. These films were shown to have a Tg that is the same as that of bulk PS (370 {$\pm$} 1 K) for all film thicknesses measured ({$>$} 7 nm). The subsequent removal of the metal layer from these films was shown to restore a thickness-dependent Tg in these samples that was essentially the same as that observed for uncapped PS films. An estimate of the thickness of the liquid-like surface layer was also extracted from the ellipsometry measurements and was found to be 5 {$\pm$} 1 nm. The combined ellipsometry and embedding studies provide strong evidence for the existence of a liquid-like surface layer in thin glassy PS films. They show that the presence of the free surface is an important parameter in determining the existence of Tg reductions in thin PS films.},

  abstract = {The structure of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) aqueous gels containing borate ions (i.e. PVA-borate gels) was investigated with small-angle neutron scattering. The correlation length {$\xi$}, a measure of the spatial length of concentration fluctuation, was estimated from a generalized Zimm plot for fractals having the fractal dimension of D. The variation of {$\xi$} with temperature showed a gel-to-sol transition. The correlation length remained constant in the gel state and decreased steeply with increasing temperature in the sol state. Even at the highest temperature of observation (95\textdegree C) {$\xi$} was a few times greater than the radius of gyration of the PVA molecules, which indicates presence of PVA clusters in the sol state. The scattered intensity functions for the gels at different temperatures could be superimposed by employing reduced variables, I(q)c{$\xi$}3 and {$\xi$}q, where c and q are the monomer concentration and the magnitude of the scattering vector, respectively. This indicates that the system is composed of domains of PVA clusters filling the space. The fractal dimension of PVA inside the domain is 2.6 to 2.8. This suggests that PVA chains in the domain are packed more densely than percolation clusters. In the sol state, the system is described as an ensemble of polydisperse clusters of D {$\backsimeq$} 2.2.},

  abstract = {The crystalline structures associated with melting and crystallization behaviors of monodisperse linear polyethylene confined in cylindrical nanopores were investigated by X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The crystalline structures, melting, and crystallization behaviors of PE under the imposed cylindrical confinement were noticeably different from those of the bulk state. The isothermal crystallization experiments showed that the overall crystallization of polyethylene in cylindrical nanopores was dominated by the nucleation rather than the growth of crystallites. The c- and a-axes of orthorhombic PE crystals developed in nanoporous alumina were preferentially oriented perpendicular to the long axis of cylindrical nanopore while the b-axis was parallel to the pore axis. The melting temperature of polyethylene in the nanopores was substantially depressed, and it was analyzed with the Thomson-Gibbs equation. The crystallinity of linear polyethylene in cylindrical nanopores was less than 50\%, whereas the bulk value was 71.6\%.},

Of special interest is the dynamic behavior close to or in interfaces, since it determines material properties and responses to external fields. Due to the broad dynamical range and the high scattering contrast for visible light, interface light scattering is a key to elucidate soft matter interfacial dynamics.

We first discuss instrumental issues such as the effects of partial coherence (or alternatively finite instrumental resolution) and optimization of signal-to-noise ratios in the experiments. We then review what has been learned from recent XPCS studies of capillary wave fluctuations on liquid surfaces and polymer films, of nanoparticles used as probes to study the interior dynamics of polymer films, of liquid crystals and multilamellar surfactant films, and of metal surfaces, and magnetic domain wall fluctuations in antiferromagnets. We then discuss studies of non-equilibrium dynamics described by 2-time correlation functions. Finally, we briefly speculate on possible future XPCS experiments at new synchrotron sources currently under development including studies of dynamics on time scales down to femtoseconds.},

A molecular layer of a density {$\sim$}18\% higher than that of the bulk is found to form at the free surface of these liquids. In common with surface layering in liquid metals and surface freezing in melts of organic chain molecules, this effect is induced by the lower dimensionality of the surface. The concentrations of the oppositely charged ions within the surface layer are determined by chemical substitution of the anion. The temperature-dependent surface tension measurements reveal a normal, negative-slope temperature dependence. The different possible molecular arrangements within the enhanced-density surface layer are discussed.},

The as-received materials had a broad size distribution, but more narrowly distributed particles were prepared by selective filtration for use in probe diffusion and stability studies. The interaction of these negatively charged particles with a linear polyelectrolyte, negatively charged sodium polystyrene sulfonate, was studied by static and dynamic light scattering. Depolarized dynamic light scattering is particularly sensitive to changes in the stability of the colloids or interaction with the polyelectrolyte. The polyelectrolyte can prevent or reverse salt-induced aggregation of the superparamagnetic latex particles. Fluorescence photobleaching recovery experiments to monitor the mobility of fluorescently labeled polyelectrolyte suggest that it is not bound to the latex particles; apparently, a mechanism other than steric stabilization is involved. The dependence of the diffusion of the superparamagnetic latex particles upon added salt is discussed in terms of the ion atmosphere surrounding the polyelectrolyte.},

Presented analysis revealed that charge diffusion in PolyILs is about 10 times slower than ion diffusion, suggesting strong ion\textendash ion correlations that reduce ionic conductivity. The activation energy for the ion diffusion shows a nonmonotonous dependence on the mobile ion size, indicating a competition between Coulombic and elastic forces controlling ion transport in PolyILs. The former dominates mobility of small ions (e.g., Li), while the latter controls mobility of large ions (e.g., TFSI). We propose a simple qualitative model describing the activation energy for the ion diffusion. It suggests that an increase in dielectric constant of PolyILs should lead to a significant enhancement of conductivity of small ions (e.g., Li and Na).},

  abstract = {A guideline for the synthesis of poly(acrylic acid) brushes on planar silica surfaces by the ``grafting-onto'' approach is described. It is demonstrated that some thermal precautions must be taken to obtain extended brushes. It is also shown that neutron reflectivity is well suited for the characterization of each step of the synthesis, while it is (unfortunately) rarely used for that purpose. The steps are the following: first, the substrates are covered with a self-assembled monolayer of epoxy-terminated molecules; then, the poly(tert-butyl acrylate) brushes are built using preformed and end-functionalized chains; finally, the deprotection of the ester group is performed using a pyrolysis reaction to convert the poly(tert-butyl acrylate) brushes into poly(acrylic acid) brushes.},

All the PS films exhibited a substantial depression in Tg with decreasing film thickness, while the extent of such depression was strongly dependent on the chemical structure of the end groups and molecular weights. It was found that Tfilmg - Tbulkg of the various PS films increased linearly with increasing hads/Rg, in which hads is the thickness of the interfacial adsorbed layer and Rg is the radius of gyration of PS. The hads/Rg is a direct reflection of the macromolecular chain conformation within the adsorbed layer which was affected by its end groups and molecular weights. These findings are in line with the work of Napolitano, and present direct experimental evidence.},

We demonstrate that within the SCFT and at low enough concentrations the properties of these systems are fully determined by the overall polymer concentration plus two reduced parameters which are derived from the SCFT. Via a suitable change of variables, the results for very different systems can thus map onto universal curves. We show that MD and SCFT results at finite concentrations nearly obey these mappings as well. These findings allow for generalized predictions of the polymer properties such as concentration profiles, chain end distributions, and when there are polymer-free ``open'' channels at the center of a cylinder. This provides useful guidance for the development of micro- and nanofluidic devices.}

Nanoclusters are expected to follow the crinkle folding mechanism, which promotes the formation of trilayers of nanoparticles but kinetically disfavors the formation of the fourth layer. Experiments LB films of Au38(SC2H4Ph)24 nanocluster were prepared at a range of surface pressures in the bilayer/trilayer regime and their internal structure was analyzed with X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) and Grazing-Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS). Bimodal atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging was used to quantify the elastic modulus, which can be correlated with the topography at the same point on the surface. Findings Nanocluster bilayers and trilayers exhibited the elastic moduli of ca. 1.2 GPa and 0.9 GPa respectively. Films transferred in the 20-25 mN/m surface pressure regime displayed a particular propensity to form highly vertically organized trilayers. Further compression resulted in disorganization of the layers. Crucially, the use of two cantilevers of contrasting stiffness for bimodal AFM measurements has demonstrated a new approach to quantify the mechanical properties of ultrathin films without the use of deconvolution algorithms to remove the substrate contribution.},

The effective viscosity and residual stresses of the as-spun films are seen to strongly depend on the properties of the casting solvent and the solvent quality. Both effects are explained in terms of the coil dimension at the solvent-polymer composition at which the film vitrifies. The more compact chains in a near-{$\Theta$}-solvent are less entangled and less deformed when quenched to the dry melt compared to the more swollen chains in an athermal solution. Despite chain conformations that are further from equilibrium for the {$\Theta$}-solvent cast chains, these films have reduced stored stresses compared to the chains cast in films from athermal solvents. A more detailed analysis of the data suggests that the formation of a surface-near region with more strongly deformed chains during spin coating. Since thermal equilibration of spin-cast high-molecular-weight films is unpractical, solvent vapor annealing was used to equilibrate films on timescale of a few hours.},

The analysis of experimental SAXS data involves mapping a rather simple data format to a vast amount of structural models. Despite various scientific computing tools to assist the model selection, the activity heavily relies on the SAXS analysts' experience, which is recognized as an efficiency bottleneck by the community. To cope with this decision-making problem, we develop and evaluate the open-source, Machine Learning-based tool SCAN (SCattering Ai aNalysis) to provide recommendations on model selection. SCAN exploits multiple machine learning algorithms and uses models and a simulation tool implemented in the SasView package for generating a well defined set of datasets. Our evaluation shows that SCAN delivers an overall accuracy of 95\%-97\%. The XGBoost Classifier has been identified as the most accurate method with a good balance between accuracy and training time. With eleven predefined structural models for common nanostructures and an easy draw-drop function to expand the number and types training models, SCAN can accelerate the SAXS data analysis workflow.},

SEM observations indicated three stages in the self-organization of nanopores in alumina: (1) nucleation of random nanopores with a broad radius distribution, (2) narrowing the radius distribution and (3) slow evolution of the nanoporous structure towards ordering of nanopores into large domains. SANS studies revealed orientational correlation between ordered domains of nanopores, which is characterized by a small misorientation angle. For the samples with high aspect ratios of nanopores, the SANS patterns showed azimuthal smearing, which was attributed to the redistribution of nanopores between the domains during their growth.},

Due to the interpenetration of the brush with the layer of ``untethered chains'' a hydrodynamic continuum theory can only describe the fluctuations when the effective thickness of the film is taken to be that which remains above the swollen brush. The portion of the film of initially untethered chains that interpenetrates with the brush becomes so viscous as to effectively play the role of a rigid substrate. Since these hybrid samples containing a covalently tethered layer at the bottom do not readily dewet, and are more robust than thin layers of untethered short chains on rigid substrates, they provide a route for tailoring polymer layer surface properties such as wetting, adhesion and friction.},

It is a simple-to-use dry process which is inexpensive to set up and operate. It can rapidly produce clean surfaces, in air or in a vacuum system, at ambient temperatures. By placing properly precleaned surfaces within a few millimeters of an ozone producing UV source, the process can produce clean surfaces in less than 1 min. The technique is capable of producing near-atomically clean surfaces, as evidenced by Auger electron spectroscopy, ESCA, and ISS/SIMS studies. Topics discussed include: the variables of the process,the types of surfaces which have been successfully cleaned, the contaminants which can be removed, the construction of a UV/ozone cleaning facility, the mechanism of the process, UV/ozone cleaning in vacuum systems, rate enhancement techniques, safety considerations, effects of UV/ozone other than cleaning, and applications.},

In the case of a squeeze-flow geometry, we show that below a critical distance Dc, the liquid is clamped by its viscosity and its intrinsic properties cannot be disentangled from the global system response. Using nanorheology experiments, we demonstrate that picometer elastic deflections of the rigid confining surfaces dominate the overall mechanical response of nanometric liquids confined between solid walls.},

Here, we report a class of solvent-free polymer electrolytes by using poly(diallyldimethylammonium) bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (PDADMA FSI) and a high content of Li bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt. A homogeneous mixture, with a Li+ ion transference number of 0.56, is found at a 1:1.5 mole ratio of PDADMA FSI:LiFSI, whereas crystalline phases are observed at higher LiFSI contents. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate a co-coordination of the FSI anion with both the Li+ and the polymer backbone, and this co-coordination is maximized at 1:1.5 mole ratio, which facilitates Li+ transport. The optimized electrolyte has been demonstrated to support long-term stable Li-metal symmetrical cycling as well as Li-metal battery cycling (Li | LiFePO4 and Li | Li1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3CoO2) at elevated temperature, with areal capacity higher than 1.1 mAh cm\`A2.},

Because of this confinement, the free chain is stretched in axial direction; while for small grafting densities of the brush the end-to-end distance increases monotonously with decreasing pore radius, a nonmonotonic variation occurs for larger grafting densities. We show that this effect is due to strong interpenetration of the free chain and the brush chains; for very narrow pores a strong layering of cylindrical shells is found, and comparison with self-consistent field calculations (SCF) shows that the latter can predict the nonmonotonic variation in qualitative accord with the simulation. The robustness of the SCF approach is then used to demonstrate the occurrence of the observed ``penetration transition'' in a broader range of chain lengths and grafting densities.},

We describe the synthesis of a series of poly(styrene-b-4-vinylbenzylalkylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) (PS-b-PVBn(alkyl)ImTFSI; alkyl = CH3 (Me), n-C4H9 (Bu), n-C6H13 (Hex)) diblock copolymers (2.7\textendash 17.0 mol \% POIL) via exhaustive functionalization and ion exchange of relatively narrow molecular weight dispersity poly(styrene-b-4-vinylbenzyl chloride) precursors derived from nitroxide-mediated block copolymerizations. The solid-state morphology of these PS-b-PVBn(alkyl)ImTFSI copolymers were studied using a combination of temperature-dependent synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). From electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, we observe that lamellar samples having similar compositions exhibit comparable values of conductivity (0.1 mS cm\textendash 1 at 150 \textdegree C) regardless of imidazolium alkyl substituent. The ionic conductivity of a compositionally varied series of PS-b-PVBnHexImTFSI diblocks depends nonlinearly on POIL composition (0.01 mS cm\textendash 1 for 8.6 mol \% POIL and 0.1 mS cm\textendash 1 for 17.0 mol \% POIL at 150 \textdegree C), thus highlighting the influence of morphology on the observed ionic conductivity of POIL block copolymers for the first time. By using different polymer processing strategies, we further demonstrate that the ionic conductivity of a single sample (8.6 mol \% POIL) may vary by more than one order of magnitude depending on the long-range ordering of the microphase separated morphology. These studies indicate that macroscopic connectivity and morphological defects strongly affect the observed conductivity in these materials.},

  abstract = {We apply our cooperative free volume (CFV) rate model for pressure-dependent dynamics to describe the relaxation times for poly(4-chlorostyrene) (P4ClS) bulk and thin films. The CFV model expresses segmental relaxation times, {$\tau$}, as a function of temperature, T, and thermodynamic free volume, Vfree = V - Vhc, where the limiting hard core volume, Vhc, is obtained via analysis of a polymer's experimental PVT data using the locally correlated lattice (LCL) model equation of state. In adapting CFV to describe thin films, we assume that the main effect of confinement is that the interface serves to change the average free volume (average density) compared to bulk. We formulate a simple weighted average expression (involving just a single interface related parameter) to describe the free volume of a film as a function of thickness, h, and use this h-dependent Vfree within the CFV model expression. Using just ambient pressure relaxation time data on bulk P4ClS, along with PVT data, we parametrize the CFV model, which is then able to predict both the Pdependent dynamics for the P4ClS bulk and the thickness-dependent dynamics of P4ClS films; the CFV parameters are transferable for either scenario. Analysis of the bulk P-dependent dynamics predictions for P4ClS indicates a strong sensitivity to volume changes, and this leads to a strong sensitivity to confinement (h). In addition, we show that the effect of confinement, e.g., for a 15 nm P4ClS film, is analogous to the effect of a P decrease on the order of about 25 MPa or so. The model {$\tau$} vs h behavior is in close agreement with the form of the isothermal experimental data. Furthermore, we show predictions for the film behavior at other temperatures, based on analysis of the limited (T = 433 K) experimental data that are available.},

Following an earlier proof-of-concept application to freestanding polystyrene (PS) films, here we both extend the study to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films and generalize the model so that it is applicable for either freestanding or supported films. In the case of the freestanding PMMA film, model predictions for the Tg suppression (relative to bulk) as a function of film thickness are in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental data, reflecting the fact that freestanding PMMA films are evidently less perturbed by the presence of free surfaces than those made of PS. We then turn to the case of PMMA films supported on a silica substrate by accounting for possible polymer\textendash substrate interactions, such that when these are switched off the same model maps smoothly back to the case of a PMMA freestanding film. We then probe the origin of the interaction required such that the model can capture the experimentally observed Tg enhancement for supported PMMA films while also accounting for the relative lack of impact on the Tg behavior of supported PS films relative to their freestanding counterparts. Finally, we make connections between related experimental and simulation studies and our own results for the differences between supported PMMA and PS films.},

The measurements were made with a commercial conductivity cell with platinum black electrodes. In order to exclude atmospheric moisture, the conductivity cell was modified so that it could be sealed during measurements. The RTILs studied were 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate. The RTILs were dried under vacuum until the mass fraction of water \dh wH2O\TH{} was 610\`A5. Coulometric Karl Fischer titration was used to determine wH2O in each RTIL before and after measurements of j. Most measurements were made on dried RTILs, but some measurements were performed intentionally at higher wH2O in order to study the effect of a water impurity on j. For \{water + 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide\}, j was found to increase dramatically with increasing wH2O; for example, in going from wH2O {$\frac{1}{4}$} 10\`A5 to 10\`A2, the fractional increase in j was 0.36 \{=(jwet \`A jdried)/jdried\}. This work illustrates the importance of measuring the water content in RTILs both before and after measurements of j.},

Apart from investigations on colloidal systems, polymer science has benefited significantly from this technique. This review will summarize FCS studies on polymer systems and, in particular, focus on the diffusion of differently sized molecular and macromolecular probes in polymer solutions, classical and responsive polymer gels, polymer melts and glasses. It will be discussed how FCS can be used to determine translational and rotational diffusion in polymer solutions and at interfaces, scaling laws, micellization and aggregation and, to some extent, polymer structure including heterogeneity. Thus, FCS should be considered a powerful complement to other methods for the investigation of polymer structure and dynamics.},

  abstract = {The conformation of the polycation in the prototypical polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) poly(3-methyl-1-aminopropylimidazolylacrylamide) bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (poly(3MAPIm)TFSI) was probed using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and ultra-small-angle neutron scattering (USANS) at 25 \textdegree C and 80 \textdegree C. Poly(3MAPIm)TFSI contains microvoids which lead to intense low q scattering that can be mitigated using mixtures of hydrogen- and deuterium-rich materials, allowing determination of the polycation conformation and radius of gyration (Rg). In the pure PIL, the polycation adopts a random coil conformation with Rg = 52 {$\pm$} 0.5 \AA. In contrast to conventional polymer melts, the pure PIL is not a theta solvent for the polycation. The TFSI- anions, which comprise 48\% v/v of the PIL, are strongly attracted to the polycation and act like small solvent molecules which leads to chain swelling analogous to an entangled, semi-dilute, or concentrated polymer solution in a good solvent.},

  abstract = {Two preparations of linear polyacrylamide with average molecular weights of 0.37 million and 1.14 million Da, and a deuterated preparation with an average molecular weight of 1.71 million Da, were used to study the effects of molecular weight, polydispersity, and concentration on the mesh size of entangled polymers in a DNA sequencing buffer solution and their ability to resolve DNA sequencing reactions by capillary electrophoresis. The polyacrylamide concentrations were above the overlap threshold C*, the concentration above which an entangled polymer network is expected to form. Small angle neutron scattering experiments showed that between 1\% and 8\% polyacrylamide, the mesh size ({$\zeta$}) can be expressed by the relation {$\zeta$} = 2.09C-0.76, where {$\zeta$} is in \AA{} and C is the polymer concentration in g/mL. The mesh size depended only on the concentration and was independent of the average molecular weight of the polyacrylamide. Consistent with this result, electrophoretic mobilities of DNA moving through the polymer network depended almost entirely on the polyacrylamide concentration and not on its molecular weight or polydispersity. Although separation was little affected, band sharpness persisted to longer DNAs when the polymer network contained a higher fraction of larger polyacrylamide molecuels. We postulate a dispersive effect that depends on the size of the DNA and the resiliency of the polymer network. This interpretation provides a rationale for optimizing the design of polymer solutions to sieve DNA for sequencing by capillary electrophoresis.},

  abstract = {Polymerized ionic liquids (PILs) doped with lithium salts have recently attracted research interests as the polymer component in lithium-ion batteries because of their high ionic mobilities and lithium-ion transference numbers. To date, although the ion transport mechanism in lithiumdoped PILs has been considerably studied, the role of lithium salts on the dynamics of PIL chains remains poorly understood. Herein, we examine the thermal and rheological behaviors of the mixture of poly(1-butyl-3-vinylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PC4-TFSI)/lithium TFSI (LiTFSI) in order to clarify the effect of the addition of LiTFSI. We show that the glass transition temperature Tg and the entanglement density decrease with the increase in LiTFSI concentration wLiTFSI. These results indicate that LiTFSI acts as a plasticizer for PC4-TFSI. Comparison of the frequency dependence of the complex modulus under the iso-frictional condition reveals that the addition of LiTFSI does not modify the stress relaxation mechanism of PC4-TFSI, including its characteristic time scale. This suggests that the doped LiTFSI, component that can be carrier ions, is not so firmly bound to the polymer chain as it modifies the chain dynamics. In addition, a broadening of the loss modulus spectrum in the glass region occurs at high wLiTFSI. This change in the spectrum can be caused by the responses of free TFSI and/or coordination complexes of Li and TFSI. Our detailed rheological analysis can extract the information of the dynamical features for PIL/salt mixtures and may provide helpful knowledge for the control of mechanical properties and ion mobilities in PILs.},

Recent progress in the preparation of PILs via controlled/``living'' radical polymerizations points out an unprecedented opportunity to precisely design and control macromolecular architecture of IL species on a meso-/nanoscale within a polymer matrix. There are also newly emerging polymerization techniques that have appeared for the preparation of PILs which have further pushed the limit of the design of PILs.

Many of these applications are underpinned by the structures and processes at the interface between polyILs and solid surfaces; however, the interfacial behavior of polyILs remains largely unexplored.

In particular, the kinetics of polyelectrolyte deposition inside the pores with a diameter of 37 {$\pm$} 3 nm and a length of 3.7 {$\pm$} 0.3 {$\mu$}m were unraveled, and potential differences in the LBL multilayer growth compared to flat silicon substrates as well as the effect of different ionic strengths and different types of ions were investigated. RIfS measures the effective optical thicknesses, which is\textemdash for a constant pore length\textemdash proportional to the effective refractive index of the AAO sample, from which, in turn, the deposited mass of the polymer or the corresponding layer thickness can be estimated. Compared to the multilayer growth by the LBL deposition on the flat aminosilane-primed silicon wafers, which was assessed by spectroscopic ellipsometry, the thickness increment per deposited bilayer, as well as the dependence of this increment on the ionic strength (0.01\textendash 0.15) and the counterion type (Na+ vs Ca2+) inside the aminosilane-primed nanopores, was for the first bilayers to within the experimental error identical. For thicker multilayers, the pore diameter became smaller, which led to reduced thickness increments and eventually virtually completely filled the pores. The observed kinetics is consistent with the mass-transport-limited adsorption of the polyelectrolyte to the charged surface according to a Langmuir isotherm with a negligible desorption rate. In addition to fundamental insights into the buildup of polyelectrolyte multilayers inside the AAO nanopores, our results highlight the sensitivity of RIfS and its use as an analytical tool for probing processes inside the nanopores and for the development of biosensors.},

Annihilation of free-volume holes through diffusion to surfaces has been proposed to determine the vitrification of the confined polymers. In this work, we assessed the hole diffusion dynamics in glassy thin poly (ethylene terephthalate) films with various thicknesses using a strategy based on covering the film surface with crystals of different sizes, which allows for changing the hole diffusion efficiency, thus tuning the glass transition temperature of the thin film (Tgfilm). The apparent activation energy for hole diffusion (Ea,hole) in the thin films was elucidated by modeling the correlation between Tgfilm and surface coverage of crystals using the free-volume hole diffusion model. Our results demonstrated a trend of linear decrease in Ea,hole with the increasing inverse film thickness (h-1), suggesting that the presence of a free surface with faster dynamics promotes hole diffusion in thin films. This finding demonstrates that the free volume release in thin films and thus the confined polymer dynamics can be modulated by changing the free surface properties of the films.},

No large gradients in the extent of collective motion exist in these simulated films, and an analysis of the mobility gradient on a layer-by-layer basis indicates that the string model provides a quantitative description of the relaxation time gradient. Consequently, the string model indicates that the interfacial mobility gradient derives mainly from a gradient in the high-temperature activation enthalpy {$\Delta$}H0 and entropy {$\Delta$}S0 as a function of depth z, an effect that exists even in the high-temperature Arrhenius relaxation regime far above the glass transition temperature. To gain insight into the interfacial mobility gradient, we examined various material properties suggested previously to influence {$\Delta$}H0 in condensed materials, including density, potential and cohesive energy density, and a local measure of stiffness or  {$\langle$} u 2 (z){$\rangle$} u2(z) -3/2, where  {$\langle$} u 2 (z){$\rangle$} u2(z)  is the average mean squared particle displacement at a caging time (on the order of a ps). We find that changes in local stiffness best correlate with changes in {$\Delta$}H0(z) and that {$\Delta$}S0(z) also contributes significantly to the interfacial mobility gradient, so it must not be neglected.},

The absolute molecular weights (MWs) of PILs were determined from size exclusion chromatography with light scattering. The degree of polymerization (N) ranged from 15 to 254, and steady rotational rheology indicated the zero-shear viscosity ({$\eta$}0) measured at a constant distance above the glass transition scales as {$\eta$}0 {$\sim$} N1.0 for N {$<$} 92, in agreement with the theory for unentangled polymer melts. In the range from N = 92\textendash 254, we measured {$\eta$}0 {$\sim$} N2.3 which is interpreted as a transition region. The N1.0 scaling in the unentangled regime is in contrast to the prior report of {$\eta$}0 {$\sim$} N1.7 in polyethylene-based PILs (Macromolecules, 2011, 44, 7719) but in agreement with a calculated {$\eta$}0 {$\sim$} N1.1 of acrylic ammonium TFSI PILs (Macromolecules, 2016, 49, 4557). Oscillatory shear rheology revealed that electrostatic interactions in this system were weak enough to have no impact on delaying the onset of flow, which was supported by a lack of ion aggregation in wide-angle X-ray scattering. The polymer nanostructure was also found to be minimally influenced by the degree of polymerization. Ionic conductivity slightly decreased as MW increased but overlapped when normalized to the calorimetric glass transition temperature.},

  abstract = {We discovered that hemoglobin emits high energy Soret fluorescence when two-photon excited by the visible femtosecond light sources. The unique spectral and temporal characteristics of hemoglobin fluorescence were measured by using a time-resolved spectroscopic detection system. The high energy Soret fluorescence of hemoglobin shows the spectral peak at 438 nm with extremely short lifetime. This discovery enables two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy to become a potentially powerful tool for in vivo label-free imaging of blood cells and vessels.},

  abstract = {Porous anodic alumina (PAA) has been intensively studied in past decade due to its applications for fabricating nanostructured materials. Since PAA's pore diameter, thickness and shape vary too much, a systematical study on the methods of morphology characterization is meaningful and essential for its proper development and utilization. In this paper, we present detailed AFM, SEM and TEM studies on PAA and its evolvements with abundant microstructures, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method. The sample preparation, testing skills and morphology analysis are discussed, especially on the differentiation during characterizing complex cross-sections and ultrasmall nanopores. The versatility of PAAs is also demonstrated by the diversity of PAAs' microstructure.},

  abstract = {The problem of the motions of a chain molecule diffusing in a viscous fluid under the influence of external forces or currents is considered for a particular model. This model is a chain of beads connected by ideal springs. Hydrodynamic interaction between the beads is introduced in the approximate form due to Kirkwood and Riseman. It is possible to solve this problem exactly with the use of a transformation to a set of normal coordinates. The viscosity,birefringence of flow, and dielectric and tensile relaxation behavior are calculated explicitly. The intrinsic viscosity in steady flow is somewhat different from the Kirkwood-Riseman result, and there is no change of viscosity with shear rate. The spectrum of relaxation times is similar to that found by Rouse and by F. Bueche, but has its maximum at a lower frequency than those obtained by Kuhn and Kuhn and by Kirkwood and Fuoss in other ways.},
